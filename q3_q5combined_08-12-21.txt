BACKGROUND: Telehealth technology and related products can help to solve the
problems associated with providing health care services and equal distribution of
resources. However, in order to run a telehealth business successfully, key
components and critical factors need to be taken into account. A telehealth
business framework can provide a rich understanding of these components and
factors. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify the key components and
critical factors for developing a telehealth business framework from the experts'
perspectives.
METHODS: The present qualitative study was conducted in 2020. The participants
were 22 experts in the fields of medical informatics, health information
management, telemedicine, telehealth, health entrepreneurship, health insurance, 
and digital health start-ups. In depth semi-structured interviews were conducted 
to collect data, and the data were analyzed using framework analysis.
RESULTS: Four main themes derived from data analysis. The themes included key
components for developing a telehealth business framework, success factors,
challenges, and barriers of a telehealth business. Overall, the results indicated
that the key components in a telehealth business framework included created
value, key resources, key activities, key partners, licenses and permissions,
product pricing, revenue, marketing, supporting services, and
getting feedback from customers. Although receiving support from different
individuals and organizations as well as economic benefits of telehealth services
may consider as success factors, there are a number of challenges and barriers
which should be taken into account. Otherwise, these factors may hinder the
success of a telehealth business.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of a telehealth business framework might be an
important step towards developing a more complete business plan, facilitating the
commercialization of telehealth products, and providing a solution for product
sustainability in a competitive market. In the current study, the key components 
and critical factors for developing a telehealth business framework were
identified; however, further research is needed to explore how these components
and factors can be helpful in developing business plans and running a successful 
telehealth business.

Disaster response procedures have been developed and improved following the Great
East Japan Earthquake. Innovative services have also been created through digital
transformation, including an acceleration and deepening of artificial
intelligence technology. Things that were once technically impossible are now
possible. These innovative technologies will spread across various fields, and
disaster response will not be an exception. The Ministry of Health, Labour and
Welfare is promoting the use of personal health records in a way that effectively
supports the management of treatments by using data from wearable devices and
specific applications. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the trade-off between
protecting personal information and enabling social benefits, such as in the use 
of digital tracking, and infodemics, including misinformation, have become new
social challenges. Reviewing past disaster preparedness and the services and
value provided by digital transformation indicates what new disaster preparedness
should be. Digital transformation does not require literacy (ability to collect, 
analyze, and use information) but competence (beneficial behavioral traits
derived from experience). Understanding behavior through data and enabling
rational behavior are crucial. By increasing human productivity, we can save time
and improve self- and mutual-help in times of disaster. Medical information and
digital services must be properly used in normal times. A society that uses such 
services will be more disaster resilient.

OBJECTIVE: The Recruitment Innovation Center (RIC), partnering with the Trial
Innovation Network and institutions in the National Institutes of
Health-sponsored Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program, aimed 
to develop a service line to retrieve study population estimates from electronic 
health record (EHR) systems for use in selecting enrollment sites for multicenter
clinical trials. Our goal was to create and field-test a low burden, low tech,
and high-yield method.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In building this service line, the RIC strove to
complement, rather than replace, CTSA hubs' existing cohort assessment tools. For
each new EHR cohort request, we work with the investigator to develop a
computable phenotype algorithm that targets the desired population. CTSA hubs run
the phenotype query and return results using a standardized survey. We provide a 
comprehensive report to the investigator to assist in study site selection.
RESULTS: From 2017 to 2020, the RIC developed and socialized 36
phenotype-dependent cohort requests on behalf of investigators. The average
response rate to these requests was 73%.
DISCUSSION: Achieving enrollment goals in a multicenter clinical trial requires
that researchers identify study sites that will provide sufficient enrollment.
The fast and flexible method the RIC has developed, with CTSA feedback, allows
hubs to query their EHR using a generalizable, vetted phenotype algorithm to
produce reliable counts of potentially eligible study participants.
CONCLUSION: The RIC's EHR cohort assessment process for evaluating sites for
multicenter trials has been shown to be efficient and helpful. The model may be
replicated for use by other programs.

BACKGROUND: A barrier to practicing evidence-based medicine is the rapidly
increasing body of biomedical literature. Use of method terms to limit the search
can help reduce the burden of screening articles for clinical relevance; however,
such terms are limited by their partial dependence on indexing terms and usually 
produce low precision, especially when high sensitivity is required. Machine
learning has been applied to the identification of high-quality literature with
the potential to achieve high precision without sacrificing sensitivity. The use 
of artificial intelligence has shown promise to improve the efficiency of
identifying sound evidence.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this research is to derive and validate deep 
learning machine models using iterations of Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT) to retrieve high-quality, high-relevance evidence for
clinical consideration from the biomedical literature.
METHODS: Using the HuggingFace Transformers library, we will experiment with
variations of BERT models, including BERT, BioBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT, to 
determine which have the best performance in article identification based on
quality criteria. Our experiments will utilize a large data set of over 150,000
PubMed citations from 2012 to 2020 that have been manually labeled based on their
methodological rigor for clinical use. We will evaluate and report on the
performance of the classifiers in categorizing articles based on their likelihood
of meeting quality criteria. We will report fine-tuning hyperparameters for each 
model, as well as their performance metrics, including recall (sensitivity),
specificity, precision, accuracy, F-score, the number of articles that need to be
read before finding one that is positive (meets criteria), and classification
probability scores.
RESULTS: Initial model development is underway, with further development planned 
for early 2022. Performance testing is expected to star in February 2022. Results
will be published in 2022.
CONCLUSIONS: The experiments will aim to improve the precision of retrieving
high-quality articles by applying a machine learning classifier to PubMed
searching.

Center (UGMLC), German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Gießen, Germany.

BACKGROUND: In the field of medicine and medical informatics, the importance of
comprehensive metadata has long been recognized, and the composition of metadata 
has become its own field of profession and research. To ensure sustainable and
meaningful metadata are maintained, standards and guidelines such as the FAIR
(Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) principles have been 
published. The compilation and maintenance of metadata is performed by field
experts supported by metadata management apps. The usability of these apps, for
example, in terms of ease of use, efficiency, and error tolerance, crucially
determines their benefit to those interested in the data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide a metadata management app with high
usability that assists scientists in compiling and using rich metadata. We aim to
evaluate our recently developed interactive web app for our collaborative
metadata repository (CoMetaR). This study reflects how real users perceive the
app by assessing usability scores and explicit usability issues.
METHODS: We evaluated the CoMetaR web app by measuring the usability of 3
modules: core module, provenance module, and data integration module. We defined 
10 tasks in which users must acquire information specific to their user role. The
participants were asked to complete the tasks in a live web meeting. We used the 
System Usability Scale questionnaire to measure the usability of the app. For
qualitative analysis, we applied a modified think aloud method with the following
thematic analysis and categorization into the ISO 9241-110 usability categories.
RESULTS: A total of 12 individuals participated in the study. We found that over 
97% (85/88) of all the tasks were completed successfully. We measured usability
scores of 81, 81, and 72 for the 3 evaluated modules. The qualitative analysis
resulted in 24 issues with the app.
CONCLUSIONS: A usability score of 81 implies very good usability for the 2
modules, whereas a usability score of 72 still indicates acceptable usability for
the third module. We identified 24 issues that serve as starting points for
further development. Our method proved to be effective and efficient in terms of 
effort and outcome. It can be adapted to evaluate apps within the medical
informatics field and potentially beyond.

Machine Learning-Based Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality With Limited Attributes
to Expedite Patient Prognosis and Triage: Retrospective Observational Study.

Doyle R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Stuart Ltd London United Kingdom.

Background: The onset and development of the COVID-19 pandemic have placed
pressure on hospital resources and staff worldwide. The integration of more
streamlined predictive modeling in prognosis and triage-related decision-making
can partly ease this pressure.
Objective: The objective of this study is to assess the performance impact of
dimensionality reduction on COVID-19 mortality prediction models, demonstrating
the high impact of a limited number of features to limit the need for complex
variable gathering before reaching meaningful risk labelling in clinical
settings.
Methods: Standard machine learning classifiers were employed to predict an
outcome of either death or recovery using 25 patient-level variables, spanning
symptoms, comorbidities, and demographic information, from a geographically
diverse sample representing 17 countries. The effects of feature reduction on the
data were tested by running classifiers on a high-quality data set of 212
patients with populated entries for all 25 available features. The full data set 
was compared to two reduced variations with 7 features and 1 feature,
respectively, extracted using univariate mutual information and chi-square
testing. Classifier performance on each data set was then assessed on the basis
of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and received operating
characteristic-derived area under the curve metrics to quantify benefit or loss
from reduction.
Results: The performance of the classifiers on the 212-patient sample resulted in
strong mortality detection, with the highest performing model achieving
specificity of 90.7% (95% CI 89.1%-92.3%) and sensitivity of 92.0% (95% CI
91.0%-92.9%). Dimensionality reduction provided strong benefits for performance. 
The baseline accuracy of a random forest classifier increased from 89.2% (95% CI 
88.0%-90.4%) to 92.5% (95% CI 91.9%-93.0%) when training on 7
chi-square-extracted features and to 90.8% (95% CI 89.8%-91.7%) when training on 
7 mutual information-extracted features. Reduction impact on a separate logistic 
classifier was mixed; however, when present, losses were marginal compared to the
extent of feature reduction, altogether showing that reduction either improves
performance or can reduce the variable-sourcing burden at hospital admission with
little performance loss. Extreme feature reduction to a single most salient
feature, often age, demonstrated large standalone explanatory power, with the
best-performing model achieving an accuracy of 81.6% (95% CI 81.1%-82.1%); this
demonstrates the relatively marginal improvement that additional variables bring 
to the tested models.
Conclusions: Predictive statistical models have promising performance in early
prediction of death among patients with COVID-19. Strong dimensionality reduction
was shown to further improve baseline performance on selected classifiers and
only marginally reduce it in others, highlighting the importance of feature
reduction in future model construction and the feasibility of deprioritizing
large, hard-to-source, and nonessential feature sets in real world settings.

This research intended to examine electronic health record (EHR) based methods
for automated estimation of morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) of prescribed
opioids in primary care research and practice. The study leveraged the health
system's audit of adults treated with long-term opioids for chronic non-cancer
pain to compare two EHR-based automated MEDD calculation methods: RxSignature
(active prescriptions' signature information) and RxQuantity (quantity dispensed 
for prescriptions issued within the past 90 days). Prescribed opioid EHR data
were extracted from the target population at a large US academic health system in
a 2-year assessment period. Forty-five 'target patients' were selected by the
health system for a manual audit by an expert physician who then 'manually'
calculated the actual MEDD over the past 90 days (RxAudit) for those with
discrepancies in the MEDD calculated with RxSignature and RxQuantity. Paired
samples t-test compared the MEDD generated by the RxSignature and RxQuantity
methods by opioid type in the target population. The audit (n=45) revealed the
RxSignature and RxQuantity methods yielded comparable MEDD results for 20
patients and discrepant results for 25 patients. The former group had opioid
prescriptions issued at regular intervals for stable, scheduled doses of opioids;
the latter group had opioid prescriptions issued irregularly or for changed daily
dosing regimen, for as-needed use, or had changes in the dosing regimen or
inactive prescriptions mislabeled as active. RxAudit of the EHR of those with
discrepant MEDD results (n=25) produced consistent results with those yielded by 
the RxQuantity, but not the RxSignature, method. Significant differences in MEDD 
were found for most opioid types when the MEDD was calculated for the target
population using the RxSignature and RxQuantity methods. In conclusion, different
EHR-based methods for MEDD calculation can lead to vastly different estimates,
with implications for research and clinical care outcomes. Standardising data
extraction and MEDD calculation algorithms could overcome these challenges,
enabling a more accurate and reproducible approach to the dose calculation for
prescribed opioids, improving the quality of research and patient safety.

Medical informatics played a decisive role in the management of the health crisis
linked to COVID-19, in particular for the support of hospital clinical,
governance and communication activities. In this article, we present the
experience of CHUV's Internal Medicine Service in these three areas, and analyse 
some critical points of our information system revealed by the crisis. The
development, implementation, and maintenance of new IT tools during the crisis is
a challenge. The involvement of medical informatics in the decision-making
processes of hospitals and the training of healthcare professionals in this field
are essential to strengthen the efficiency of information technologies and the
innovation of our healthcare systems.

PURPOSE: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used successfully in
cardiovascular system research to analyze the physiological processes inside
vessels. We evaluated the hydraulic information of urine through the lower
urinary tract in a patient with posterior urethral valve (PUV) before and after
valve ablation by CFD.
METHODS: A set of models of the lower urinary tract were developed based on
geometrical data obtained by cystoscopy and voiding cystourethrography. Simulated
assumptions and conditions were applied according to prior studies and urodynamic
results. We used Fluent CFD 19.0 (Ansys Inc., USA) to compute the velocity and
pressure of the fluid regions. The simplification of Bernoulli's formula was
applied afterward to calculate the hydraulic energy of different positions.
RESULTS: The urine flow rates of the NORMALst, the PUVst, and the POSTst at
5000 Pa were 18.08 ml/s, 11.14 ml/s, and 12.16 ml/s, respectively. Precipitous
pressure change was observed around the valve in the PUVst, and the abnormal
change was concentrated in the dilated urethra in the POSTst. Major energy
dissipations were generated around the valve and the dilated urethra in the
PUVst. The energy loss that occurred in the dilated urethra did not improve after
the operation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are probably indicative of the hydrodynamics changes in
the dilated urethra in PUV and need to be confirmed through more improved CFD
models in the future. CFD may revolutionize pediatric urologists' perception in
the management of urinary disease.

BACKGROUND: MyDiabetesPlan is a web-based, interactive patient decision aid that 
facilitates patient-centred, diabetes-specific, goal-setting and shared
decision-making (SDM) with interprofessional health care teams.
OBJECTIVE: Assess the feasibility of (1) conducting a cluster randomized
controlled trial (RCT) and (2) integrating MyDiabetesPlan into interprofessional 
primary care clinics.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster RCT in 10 interprofessional primary care clinics 
with patients living with diabetes and at least two other comorbidities; half of 
the clinics were assigned to MyDiabetesPlan and half were assigned to usual care.
To assess recruitment, retention, and resource use, we used RCT conduct logs and 
financial account summaries. To assess intervention fidelity, we used RCT conduct
logs and website usage logs. To identify barriers and facilitators to integration
of MyDiabetesPlan into clinical care across the IP team, we used audiotapes of
clinical encounters in the intervention groups.
RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and ninety-seven potentially eligible patients
were identified through searches of electronic medical records, of which 1113
patients met the eligibility criteria upon detailed chart review. A total of 425 
patients were randomly selected; of these, 213 were able to participate and were 
allocated (intervention: n = 102; control: n = 111), for a recruitment rate of
50.1%. One hundred and fifty-one patients completed the study, for a retention
rate of 70.9%. A total of 5745 personnel-hours and $6104 CAD were attributed to
recruitment and retention activities. A total of 179 appointments occurred (out
of 204 expected appointments-two per participant over the 12-month study period; 
87.7%). Forty (36%), 25 (23%), and 32 (29%) patients completed MyDiabetesPlan at 
least twice, once, and zero times, respectively. Mean time for completion of
MyDiabetesPlan by the clinician and the patient during initial appointments was
37 min. From the clinical encounter transcripts, we identified diverse strategies
used by clinicians and patients to integrate MyDiabetesPlan into the appointment,
characterized by rapport building and individualization. Barriers to use included
clinician-related, patient-related, and technical factors.
CONCLUSION: An interprofessional approach to SDM using a decision aid was
feasible. Lower than expected numbers of diabetes-specific appointments and use
of MyDiabetesPlan were observed. Addressing facilitators and barriers identified 
in this study will promote more seamless integration into clinical care. Trial

PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to analyze the effects on patient access
by decreasing missed appointments after hiring a clinic coordinator using medical
informatics.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis of the rates of missed
appointments before and after hiring a clinic coordinator in a multidisciplinary 
spinal differences clinic were analyzed using a commercially available business
software system (SAP® Business Objects). The total number of clinic visits was
collected for each month to determine the access available for patients.
RESULTS: The median number of missed appointments per clinic by month before
employing the clinic coordinator was higher than in the two years following
implementation (p <  0.0005). No differences were seen in the number of available
appointment slots per month indicating no new clinics were needed to improve
patient access (p = 0.551). Projected billing amounts prior to hiring the clinic 
coordinator indicated that $91,520 was lost in the 2 years prior to hiring this
coordinator compared to $30,160 lost during the 2 years following the creation of
this position (p = 0.0009).
CONCLUSION: Hiring a clinic coordinator decreased the rate of missed appointments
and was a cost-efficient intervention to improve patient access and provide
effective patient care in a multidisciplinary setting.

Implementing the best research principles initiates an important shift in
clinical research culture, improving efficiency and the level of evidence
obtained. In this article, we share our own view on the best research practice
and our experience introducing it into the scientific activities of the N.N.
Burdenko National Medical Research Center of Neurosurgery (Moscow, Russian
Federation). While being adherent to the principles described in the article, the
percentage of publications in the international scientific journals in our Center
has increased from 7% to 27%, with an overall gain in the number of articles by 2
times since 2014. We believe it is important that medical informatics
professionals equally to medical experts involved in clinical research are
familiar with the best research principles.

OBJECTIVES: High rates of depression and suicide and a lack of trained
psychiatrists have emerged as significant concerns in the low-income and
middle-income countries (LMICs) such as the Pacific Island Countries (PICs).
Readily available smartphones were leveraged with community health nurses (CHNs) 
in task-sharing for early identification of suicide and depression risks in Fiji 
Islands, the largest of PICs. This investigation examines how CHNs can
efficiently and effectively process patient information about depression and
suicide risk for making diagnostic and management decisions without compromising 
safety. The research is driven by the theoretical framework of text comprehension
(knowledge representation and interpretation) and decision-making.
METHODS: Mobile health (mHealth) Application for Suicide Risk and Depression
Assessment (ASRaDA) was designed to include culturally useful clinical guidelines
for these disorders. A representative sample of 48 CHNs was recruited and
presented with two clinical cases (depression and suicide) in a simulated setting
under three conditions: No support, paper-based and mobile-based culturally valid
guideline support. Data were collected as the nurses read through the scenarios, 
'thinking aloud', before summarising, diagnoses and follow-up recommendations.
Transcribed audiotapes were analysed using formal qualitative discourse analysis 
methods for diagnostic accuracy, comprehension of clinical problems and reasoning
patterns.
RESULTS: Using guidelines on ASRaDA, the CHNs took less time to process patient
information with more accurate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions for
depression and suicide risk than with paper-based or no guideline conditions. A
change in reasoning pattern for nurses' information processing was observed with 
decision support.DiscussionAlthough these results are shown in a mental health
setting in Fiji, there are reasons to believe they are generalisable beyond
mental health and other lower-to-middle income countries.
CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate clinical guidelines on mHealth supports
efficient information processing for quick and accurate decisions and a positive 
shift in reasoning behaviour by the nurses. However, translating complex
qualitative patient information into quantitative scores could generate
conceptual errors. These results are valid in simulated conditions.

Administration of red ginseng regulates microRNA expression in a mouse model of
endometriosis.

Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

Objective: Red ginseng (RG) exerts anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and
immunomodulatory effects on endometriosis through the regulation of microRNA
(miRNA) expression. It may also ameliorate endometriosis by affecting the
expression of multiple miRNAs simultaneously, rather than acting on a single
miRNA at a given time. Since studies on the overall effects of RG on
endometriosis via the regulation of miRNA expression are lacking, the current
study aimed to explore the global effect of RG on miRNA expression in a mouse
model of endometriosis.
Methods: To establish the mouse model, the uterine horn of donor mice was
implanted into the lateral side of the recipients' peritoneum, followed by
vehicle or RG treatment for 8 weeks.
Results: To confirm the effects of RG on the established mouse model, the size of
the implanted uterus was measured; it was found to be lower in mice from the RG
group than in mice from the control group. miRNA expression profiles in the
implanted uterus of the mouse model of endometriosis after vehicle or RG
administration were analyzed using microarray technology. Thereafter, seven
candidate miRNAs and 125 candidate genes (miRNA targets) were identified through 
a bioinformatics analysis.
Conclusion: The present findings suggest that RG regulates the expression of
multiple miRNAs and mRNAs, thereby alleviating endometriosis in a mouse model of 
the disease.

The Relationship Between Electronic Health Record System and Performance on
Quality Measures in the American College of Rheumatology's Rheumatology
Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) Registry: Observational Study.

BACKGROUND: Routine collection of disease activity (DA) and patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are nationally endorsed quality
measures and critical components of a treat-to-target approach. However, little
is known about the role electronic health record (EHR) systems play in
facilitating performance on these measures.
OBJECTIVE: Using the American College Rheumatology's (ACR's) RISE registry, we
analyzed the relationship between EHR system and performance on DA and functional
status (FS) quality measures.
METHODS: We analyzed data collected in 2018 from practices enrolled in RISE. We
assessed practice-level performance on quality measures that require DA and FS
documentation. Multivariable linear regression and zero-inflated negative
binomial models were used to examine the independent effect of EHR system on
practice-level quality measure performance, adjusting for practice
characteristics and patient case-mix.
RESULTS: In total, 220 included practices cared for 314,793 patients with RA.
NextGen was the most commonly used EHR system (34.1%). We found wide variation in
performance on DA and FS quality measures by EHR system (median 30.1, IQR 0-74.8,
and median 9.0, IQR 0-74.2), respectively). Even after adjustment, NextGen
practices performed significantly better than Allscripts on the DA measure (51.4%
vs 5.0%; P<.05) and significantly better than eClinicalWorks and eMDs on the FS
measure (49.3% vs 29.0% and 10.9%; P<.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Performance on national RA quality measures was associated with the 
EHR system, even after adjusting for practice and patient characteristics. These 
findings suggest that future efforts to improve quality of care in RA should
focus not only on provider performance reporting but also on developing and
implementing rheumatology-specific standards across EHRs.

A previous Informatics Education column argued that, while instruction is a
competency defined by the Medical Library Association and is a job requirement
for many public services librarians, little opportunity exists for learning how
to teach in formal training venues, such as library school, relegating librarians
to learn how to teach on their own. After examining some of the literature
surrounding pedagogy for medical informatics librarians, a link to a brief,
informal survey on pedagogical training needs was provided. This column follows
up with results from that needs assessment.

BACKGROUND: Privacy is of increasing interest in the present big data era,
particularly the privacy of medical data. Specifically, differential privacy has 
emerged as the standard method for preservation of privacy during data analysis
and publishing.
OBJECTIVE: Using machine learning techniques, we applied differential privacy to 
medical data with diverse parameters and checked the feasibility of our
algorithms with synthetic data as well as the balance between data privacy and
utility.
METHODS: All data were normalized to a range between -1 and 1, and the bounded
Laplacian method was applied to prevent the generation of out-of-bound values
after applying the differential privacy algorithm. To preserve the cardinality of
the categorical variables, we performed postprocessing via discretization. The
algorithm was evaluated using both synthetic and real-world data (from the eICU
Collaborative Research Database). We evaluated the difference between the
original data and the perturbated data using misclassification rates and the mean
squared error for categorical data and continuous data, respectively. Further, we
compared the performance of classification models that predict in-hospital
mortality using real-world data.
RESULTS: The misclassification rate of categorical variables ranged between 0.49 
and 0.85 when the value of ε was 0.1, and it converged to 0 as ε increased. When 
ε was between 102 and 103, the misclassification rate rapidly dropped to 0.
Similarly, the mean squared error of the continuous variables decreased as ε
increased. The performance of the model developed from perturbed data converged
to that of the model developed from original data as ε increased. In particular, 
the accuracy of a random forest model developed from the original data was 0.801,
and this value ranged from 0.757 to 0.81 when ε was 10-1 and 104, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We applied local differential privacy to medical domain data, which 
are diverse and high dimensional. Higher noise may offer enhanced privacy, but it
simultaneously hinders utility. We should choose an appropriate degree of noise
for data perturbation to balance privacy and utility depending on specific
situations.

Innovation, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

Care, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.

OBJECTIVE: Suboptimal design of health information technology (IT) systems can
lead to the introduction of errors in the diagnostic process. We aimed to
identify mechanisms that can affect the safety and effectiveness of these systems
in hospital settings thus contributing to the building of an explicit and
replicable understanding of the variables that can affect the functioning of IT
systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This qualitative study drew from observations and
semistructured interviews from a purposive sample of 46 participants (26
emergency department and 20 laboratory and medical imaging staff) across 3
Australian hospitals. Iterative, inductive coding of the data led to the
development of higher-level themes based on relationships between codes.
RESULTS: Two overarching themes emerged: (1) usability and safety of the
electronic test result management system; and (2) system redesign considerations 
about who is meant to follow up, when and how. The usability and safety of
digital systems and the way these systems deal with accountability processes are 
triggered by mechanisms that are contextually dependent.
DISCUSSION: Our findings highlighted the multitransactional nature of the test
result management process involving numerous healthcare professionals across
different settings. This communication requires integration of the systems
utilized by different departments and transparency of the test result follow-up
process to facilitate clear lines of responsibility and accountability.
CONCLUSION: Identifying mechanisms that shape the functionality and
sustainability of electronic result management can offer a valuable appreciation 
of key elements that need to be accounted for, and the circumstances in which
they need to operate effectively.

Kidney stones, like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, affect a large
number of people. Patients suffer from acute pain, repeated hospitalizations and 
associated secondary diseases, such as arterial hypertension and renal
insufficiency. This results in considerable costs for the society and its health 
care system. The recurrence rate is as high as 50%. The registry for RECurrent
URolithiasis (RECUR) aims to fill existing evidence gaps. The prospective and
longitudinal RECUR registry is funded by the German Ministry of Education and
Science (BMBF). It is based on the digital infrastructure of the German Medical
Informatics Initiative (MII). RECUR aims to include patients that have suffered
from more than one stone occurrence and treated at any one of the ten
participating university hospitals of the MIRACUM consortium. The intention is to
obtain new information on risk factors and to evaluate different diagnosis and
treatment algorithms. Along with the data form the patient's Electronic Health
Records (EHR), the RECUR project will also collect Patient Reported Outcomes data
from patients with recurrent kidney stones. These data will be collected at
participating sites using digital questionnaires via a smartphone app. These data
will be merged with medical data from the hospital information systems and saved 
in the MII research data repositories. The RECUR registry has a model character
due to its fully federated, digital approach. This allows the recruitment of many
patients, the collection of a wide range of data and their processing with low
administrative and personnel costs.

Publisher: Nierensteine werden wie Herz-Kreislauf-Erkrankungen und Diabetes
mellitus aufgrund ihrer Häufigkeit zu den Volkskrankheiten gezählt. Erkrankte
können durch akute Schmerzen, wiederholte Krankenhausaufenthalte und relevante
Folgeerkrankungen belastet sein. Daraus folgen auch erhebliche Kosten, die
Gesellschaft und Gesundheitssystem tragen müssen. Die Rezidivrate liegt bei 50%. 
Mit dem Register für RECurrente URolithiasis (RECUR) sollen bestehenden
Evidenzlücken geschlossen werden. Dabei handelt es sich um ein prospektives
longitudinales Register, dessen Aufbau und Implementierung vom Bundesministerium 
für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) im Rahmen der Förderung „Aufbau modellhafter,
patientenbezogener Register für die Versorgungsforschung“ finanziert wird. Es
basiert auf der digitalen Infrastruktur der Medizininformatik-Initiative des
BMBF. Ziel ist es, möglichst viele Patient*innen der 10 teilnehmenden Kliniken
mit mehr als einer Nierenstein-Episode einzuschließen, um neue Erkenntnisse über 
Risikofaktoren, Diagnose- und Behandlungsalgorithmen zu erhalten. Im Rahmen des
RECUR Projekts sollen neben klinischen Routinedaten auch „Patient Reported
Outcomes“ von Patienten mit rezidivierenden Nierensteinen erhoben werden. Die
Erhebung dieser Daten werden für alle teilnehmenden Standorte in Form von
digitalen Fragebögen mithilfe einer Smartphone App durchgeführt und mit den
medizinischen Daten aus dem Krankenhausinformationssystemen in pseudonymisierter 
Form zusammengeführt. Das RECUR-Register hat durch seinen vollständig
föderierten, digitalen Ansatz einen modellhaften Charakter. Dieser ermöglicht die
Rekrutierung vieler Patient*innen, die Erfassung eines breiten Datenspektrums und
dessen Aufbereitung bei gleichzeitig geringem Verwaltungs- und Personalaufwand.

Self-management through mHealth by mobile apps creates new opportunities for
people living with HIV (PLHIV) for integrated and accurate management. Our study 
focused on current evidence on HIV selfmanagement mobile applications to identify
and assess their objective, infrastructure, and target populations. A systematic 
review was conducted on studies that use apps to improve self-management among
HIV-positive patients, using PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Science direct, UpToDate,
and Web of Science databases. The search was limited to English-written articles 
and published in the past 10 years. A search of Google Play for Android and App
Store for iOS devices was performed to find the apps identified in the included
articles. Concerning the aim of this study, the target populations of 17
identified HIV-apps were found to be mainly directed at PLHIV (n = 15).
Furthermore, the objectives of 17 identified HIV-apps were found to self-care,
self-monitoring, and self-management (n = 7), improve medication adherence (n =
5), prevention and treatment (n = 5), adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
(n = 4), Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (n = 1), and support safer
conception among HIV couples (n = 1). The operating system of most HIV-apps was
Android (n = 15), one app for iOS and seven apps was both of them, and most apps 
were free (n = 19). The findings indicate that mHealth strategies for PLHIV have 
had a substantial positive effect on ART, drug adherence, prevention, and
treatment, as well as social and behavioral problems affecting PLHIV. Even though
the mHealth market needs to be regulated, it specifies that mHealth is relevant
and should be used in the self-management, self-monitoring, and self-care of
PLHIV.

Background and Objectives: Preoperative planning utilizing computed tomographies 
(CT) is of utmost importance in functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS).
Frequently, no uniform documentation and planning structures are available to
residents in training. Consequently, overall completeness and quality of
operation planning may vary greatly. The objective of the present study was to
evaluate the impact of a structured operation planning (SOP) approach on the
report quality and user convenience during a 4-day sinus surgery course.
Materials and Methods: Fifteen participant were requested to plan a FESS
procedure based on a CT scan of the paranasal sinuses that exhibited common
pathological features, in a conventional manner, using a free text. Afterwards,
the participants reevaluated the same scans by means of a specifically designed
structured reporting template. Two experienced ENT surgeons assessed the
collected conventional operation planning (COP) and SOP methods independently
with regard to time requirements, overall quality, and legibility. User
convenience data were collected by utilizing visual analogue scales. Results: A
significantly greater time expenditure was associated with SOPs (183 s vs. 297 s,
p = 0.0003). Yet, legibility (100% vs. 72%, p < 0.0001) and overall completeness 
(61.3% vs. 22.7%, p < 0.0001) of SOPs was significantly superior to COPs.
Additionally, description of highly relevant variants in anatomy and pathologies 
were outlined in greater detail. User convenience data delineated a significant
preference for SOPs (VAS 7.9 vs. 6.9, p = 0.0185). Conclusions: CT-based planning
of FESS procedures by residents in training using a structured approach is more
time-consuming while producing a superior report quality in terms of detailedness
and readability. Consequently, SOP can be considered as a valuable tool in the
process of preoperative evaluations, especially within residency.

The objective is to report on the design and evaluation of the inaugural Women in
AMIA Leadership Program. A year-long leadership curriculum was developed. Survey 
responses were summarized with descriptive statistics and quotes selected.
Twenty-four scholars participated in the program. There was a significant
increase in perceived achievement of learning objectives after the program (P <
.0001). The largest improvement was in leadership confidence and presence in work
interactions (modal answer Neutral in presurvey from 21 responses rose to Agree
in postsurvey from 24 responses). Most (92% of 13) scholars clarified leadership 
vision and goals and (83% of 18) would be Very Likely to recommend the program to
others. The goals of the program-developing women's leader identity, increasing
networks, and accumulating experience for future programs-were achieved. The
second leadership program is on its way in the United States and Australia. This 
study may benefit organizations seeking to develop leadership programs for women 
in informatics and digital health.

In this unprecedented era of the overwhelming volume of medical data, machine
learning can be a promising tool that may shed light on an individualized
approach and a better understanding of the disease in the field of osteoporosis
research, similar to that in other research fields. This review aimed to provide 
an overview of the latest studies using machine learning to address issues,
mainly focusing on osteoporosis and fractures. Machine learning models for
diagnosing and classifying osteoporosis and detecting fractures from images have 
shown promising performance. Fracture risk prediction is another promising field 
of research, and studies are being conducted using various data sources. However,
these approaches may be biased due to the nature of the techniques or the quality
of the data. Therefore, more studies based on the proposed guidelines are needed 
to improve the technical feasibility and generalizability of artificial
intelligence algorithms.

OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest superior outcomes with use of intravenous (IV)
balanced fluids compared to normal saline (NS). However, significant fluid
prescribing variability persists, highlighting the knowledge-to-practice gap. We 
sought to identify contributors to prescribing variation and utilize a clinical
decision support system (CDSS) to increase institutional balanced fluid
prescribing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center informatics-enabled quality improvement
initiative for patients hospitalized or treated in the emergency department
included stepwise interventions of 1) identification of design factors within the
computerized provider order entry (CPOE) of our electronic health record (EHR)
that contribute to preferential NS ordering, 2) clinician education, 3) fluid
stocking modifications, 4) re-design and implementation of a CDSS-integrated IV
fluid ordering panel, and 5) comparison of fluid prescribing before and after the
intervention. EHR-derived prescribing data was analyzed via single interrupted
time series.
RESULTS: Pre-intervention (3/2019-9/2019), balanced fluids comprised 33% of
isotonic fluid orders, with gradual uptake (1.4%/month) of balanced fluid
prescribing. Clinician education (10/2019-2/2020) yielded a modest (4.4%/month,
95% CI 1.6-7.2, p = 0.01) proportional increase in balanced fluid prescribing,
while CPOE redesign (3/2020) yielded an immediate (20.7%, 95% CI 17.7-23.6,
p < 0.0001) and sustained increase (72% of fluid orders in 12/2020). The
intervention proved most effective among those with lower baseline balanced
fluids utilization, including emergency medicine (57% increase, 95% CI 0.7-1.8,
p < 0.0001) and internal medicine/subspecialties (18% increase, 95% CI 14.4-21.3,
p < 0.0001) clinicians and substantially reduced institutional prescribing
variation.
CONCLUSION: Integration of CDSS into an EHR yielded a robust and sustained
increase in balanced fluid prescribing. This impact far exceeded that of
clinician education highlighting the importance of CDSS.

BACKGROUND: Diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) are computer programs
aimed to improve health care by supporting clinicians in the process of
diagnostic decision-making. Previous studies on DDSS demonstrated their ability
to enhance clinicians' diagnostic skills, prevent diagnostic errors, and reduce
hospitalization costs. Despite the potential benefits, their utilization in
clinical practice is limited, emphasizing the need for new and improved products.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conduct a preliminary analysis of the
diagnostic performance of "Kahun," a new artificial intelligence-driven
diagnostic tool.
METHODS: Diagnostic performance was evaluated based on the program's ability to
"solve" clinical cases from the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 
2 Clinical Skills board exam simulations that were drawn from the case banks of 3
leading preparation companies. Each case included 3 expected differential
diagnoses. The cases were entered into the Kahun platform by 3 blinded junior
physicians. For each case, the presence and the rank of the correct diagnoses
within the generated differential diagnoses list were recorded. Each diagnostic
performance was measured in two ways: first, as diagnostic sensitivity, and
second, as case-specific success rates that represent diagnostic
comprehensiveness.
RESULTS: The study included 91 clinical cases with 78 different chief complaints 
and a mean number of 38 (SD 8) findings for each case. The total number of
expected diagnoses was 272, of which 174 were different (some appeared more than 
once). Of the 272 expected diagnoses, 231 (87.5%; 95% CI 76-99) diagnoses were
suggested within the top 20 listed diagnoses, 209 (76.8%; 95% CI 66-87) were
suggested within the top 10, and 168 (61.8%; 95% CI 52-71) within the top 5. The 
median rank of correct diagnoses was 3 (IQR 2-6). Of the 91 expected diagnoses,
62 (68%; 95% CI 59-78) of the cases were suggested within the top 20 listed
diagnoses, 44 (48%; 95% CI 38-59) within the top 10, and 24 (26%; 95% CI 17-35)
within the top 5. Of the 91 expected diagnoses, in 87 (96%; 95% CI 91-100), at
least 2 out of 3 of the cases' expected diagnoses were suggested within the top
20 listed diagnoses; 78 (86%; 95% CI 79-93) were suggested within the top 10; and
61 (67%; 95% CI 57-77) within the top 5.
CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic support tool evaluated in this study demonstrated
good diagnostic accuracy and comprehensiveness; it also had the ability to manage
a wide range of clinical findings.

Countries Based on the OpenEHR Approach: Comparative Study of Acute Coronary
Syndrome Registries.

BACKGROUND: The semantic interoperability of health care information has been a
critical challenge in medical informatics and has influenced the integration,
sharing, analysis, and use of medical big data. International standard
organizations have developed standards, approaches, and models to improve and
implement semantic interoperability. The openEHR approach-one of the standout
semantic interoperability approaches-has been implemented worldwide to improve
semantic interoperability based on reused archetypes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to verify the feasibility of implementing semantic
interoperability in different countries by comparing the openEHR-based
information models of 2 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) registries from China and
New Zealand.
METHODS: A semantic archetype comparison method was proposed to determine the
semantics reuse degree of reused archetypes in 2 ACS-related clinical registries 
from 2 countries. This method involved (1) determining the scope of reused
archetypes; (2) identifying corresponding data items within corresponding
archetypes; (3) comparing the semantics of corresponding data items; and (4)
calculating the number of mappings in corresponding data items and analyzing
results.
RESULTS: Among the related archetypes in the two ACS-related, openEHR-based
clinical registries from China and New Zealand, there were 8 pairs of reusable
archetypes, which included 89 pairs of corresponding data items and 120
noncorresponding data items. Of the 89 corresponding data item pairs, 87 pairs
(98%) were mappable and therefore supported semantic interoperability, and 71
pairs (80%) were labeled as "direct mapping" data items. Of the 120
noncorresponding data items, 114 (95%) data items were generated via archetype
evolution, and 6 (5%) data items were generated via archetype localization.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the semantic comparison between the two ACS-related
clinical registries prove the feasibility of establishing the semantic
interoperability of health care data from different countries based on the
openEHR approach. Archetype reuse provides data on the degree to which semantic
interoperability exists when using the openEHR approach. Although the openEHR
community has effectively promoted archetype reuse and semantic interoperability 
by providing archetype modeling methods, tools, model repositories, and archetype
design patterns, the uncontrolled evolution of archetypes and inconsistent
localization have resulted in major challenges for achieving higher levels of
semantic interoperability.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented pressure on hospitals
globally. Digital tools developed before the crisis provided novel aspects of
management, and new digital tools were rapidly developed as the crisis
progressed. In our institution, a digitally mature NHS Trust in England which
builds software systems, development during the early months of the crisis
allowed increased patient safety and care, efficient management of the hospital
and publication of data. The aim of this paper is to present this experience as a
case study, describing development and lessons learned applicable to wider
electronic healthcare record development.
Methods: Request, triage, build and test processes for the digital systems were
altered in response to the pandemic. Senior Responsible Officers appointed for
the emergency triaged all changes and were supported by expert opinion and
research active clinicians. Build and test cycles were compressed. New tools were
built or existing ones modified in the central Electronic Healthcare Record, PICS
(Prescribing, Information and Communication System), Clinical Dashboards and
video platforms for remote consultation were developed.
Findings: 2236 patients were admitted to UHB with suspected COVID-19 between
March and May 2020. Dashboards and visualisation tools enabled by efficient
real-time data collection for all new patients, contributed to strategic,
operational and clinical decision making.Over 70 urgent changes were made to
digital systems, including a screening proforma, improved infection control
functions, help and order panels, data dashboards, and updated prescribing
features. Novel uses were found for existing functions.
Interpretation: Digital tools contributed to a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 
in an area with a high disease burden. Change management processes were modified 
during the pandemic and successfully delivered rapid software modifications and
new tools. Principal benefits came from the ability to adapt systems to rapidly
changing clinical situations. Lessons learned from this intense development
period are widely applicable to EHR development.
Lay summary: Digital tools, which are well designed, can help clinicians and
safeguard patients. Health crises such as the COVID pandemic drove rapid
development of digital tools. This case study outlines accelerated development
within a governance framework that successfully reused existing tools and built
new ones. The lessons from this development are generalizable to digital
developments in healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Despite wide usage across all areas of medicine, it is uncertain how 
useful standard reference ranges of laboratory values are for critically ill
patients.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the distributions of standard
laboratory measurements in more than 330 selected intensive care units (ICUs)
across the USA, Amsterdam, Beijing and Tarragona; compare differences and
similarities across different geographical locations and evaluate how they may be
associated with differences in length of stay (LOS) and mortality in the ICU.
METHODS: A multi-centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study of data from five
databases for adult patients first admitted to an ICU between 2001 and 2019 was
conducted. The included databases contained patient-level data regarding
demographics, interventions, clinical outcomes and laboratory results. Kernel
density estimation functions were applied to the distributions of laboratory
tests, and the overlapping coefficient and Cohen standardised mean difference
were used to quantify differences in these distributions.
RESULTS: The 259 382 patients studied across five databases in four countries
showed a high degree of heterogeneity with regard to demographics, case mix,
interventions and outcomes. A high level of divergence in the studied laboratory 
results (creatinine, haemoglobin, lactate, sodium) from the locally used
reference ranges was observed, even when stratified by outcome.
CONCLUSION: Standardised reference ranges have limited relevance to ICU patients 
across a range of geographies. The development of context-specific reference
ranges, especially as it relates to clinical outcomes like LOS and mortality, may
be more useful to clinicians.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With aging, patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD)
show progressive decrease in kidney function. We investigated whether the
deviation of biological age (BA) from the chronological age (CA) due to DKD can
be used (denoted as Kidney Age Index; KAI) to quantify kidney function using
machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: Three large datasets were used in this study to develop KAI. The machine
learning algorithms were trained on PREVEND dataset with healthy subjects
(N = 7963) using 13 clinical markers to predict the CA. The trained model was
then used to predict the BA of patients with DKD using RENAAL (N = 1451) and IDNT
(N = 1706). The performance of four traditional machine learning algorithms were 
evaluated and the KAI = BA-CA was estimated for each patient.
RESULTS: The neural network model achieved the best performance and predicted the
CA of healthy subjects in PREVEND dataset with a mean absolute deviation
(MAD) = 6.5 ± 3.5 years and pearson correlation = 0.62. Patients with DKD showed 
a significant higher KAI of 15.4 ± 11.8 years and 13.6 ± 12.3 years in RENAAL and
IDNT datasets, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that for a given CA, patients with DKD shows
excess BA when compared to their healthy counterparts due to disease severity.
With further improvement, the proposed KAI can be used as a complementary
easy-to-interpret tool to give a more inclusive idea into disease state.

sedation. Distinguishing between capnography waveform abnormalities that signal
the need for clinical intervention for an event and those that do not indicate
the need for intervention is essential for the successful implementation of this 
technology into practice. It is possible that capnography alarm management may be
improved by using machine learning to create a "smart alarm" that can alert
clinicians to apneic events that are predicted to be prolonged.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of machine learning models for predicting at
the 15-second time point if apnea will be prolonged (ie, apnea that persists for 
>30 seconds).
METHODS: A secondary analysis of an observational study was conducted. We
selected several candidate models to evaluate, including a random forest model,
generalized linear model (logistic regression), least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator regression, ridge regression, and the XGBoost model.
Out-of-sample accuracy of the models was calculated using 10-fold
cross-validation. The net benefit decision analytic measure was used to assist
with deciding whether using the models in practice would lead to better outcomes 
on average than using the current default capnography alarm management
strategies. The default strategies are the aggressive approach, in which an alarm
is triggered after brief periods of apnea (typically 15 seconds) and the
conservative approach, in which an alarm is triggered for only prolonged periods 
of apnea (typically >30 seconds).
RESULTS: A total of 384 apneic events longer than 15 seconds were observed in 61 
of the 102 patients (59.8%) who participated in the observational study. Nearly
half of the apneic events (180/384, 46.9%) were prolonged. The random forest
model performed the best in terms of discrimination (area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve 0.66) and calibration. The net benefit associated 
with the random forest model exceeded that associated with the aggressive
strategy but was lower than that associated with the conservative strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision curve analysis indicated that using a random forest model
would lead to a better outcome for capnography alarm management than using an
aggressive strategy in which alarms are triggered after 15 seconds of apnea. The 
model would not be superior to the conservative strategy in which alarms are only
triggered after 30 seconds.

BACKGROUND: Quantitative, reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the
gold-standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection and it is also used for detection of other
virus. Manual data analysis of a small number of qRT-PCR plates per day is a
relatively simple task, but automated, integrative strategies are needed if a
laboratory is dealing with hundreds of plates per day, as is being the case in
the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: Here we present shinyCurves, an online shiny-based, free software to
analyze qRT-PCR amplification data from multi-plate and multi-platform formats.
Our shiny application does not require any programming experience and is able to 
call samples Positive, Negative or Undetermined for viral infection according to 
a number of user-defined settings, apart from providing a complete set of melting
and amplification curve plots for the visual inspection of results.
CONCLUSIONS: shinyCurves is a flexible, integrative and user-friendly software
that speeds-up the analysis of massive qRT-PCR data from different sources, with 
the possibility of automatically producing and evaluating melting and
amplification curve plots.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a major public health concern. Given the extent of the
pandemic, it is urgent to identify risk factors associated with disease severity.
More accurate prediction of those at risk of developing severe infections is of
high clinical importance.
OBJECTIVE: Based on the UK Biobank (UKBB), we aimed to build machine learning
models to predict the risk of developing severe or fatal infections, and uncover 
major risk factors involved.
METHODS: We first restricted the analysis to infected individuals (n=7846), then 
performed analysis at a population level, considering those with no known
infection as controls (ncontrols=465,728). Hospitalization was used as a proxy
for severity. A total of 97 clinical variables (collected prior to the COVID-19
outbreak) covering demographic variables, comorbidities, blood measurements (eg, 
hematological/liver/renal function/metabolic parameters), anthropometric
measures, and other risk factors (eg, smoking/drinking) were included as
predictors. We also constructed a simplified (lite) prediction model using 27
covariates that can be more easily obtained (demographic and comorbidity data).
XGboost (gradient-boosted trees) was used for prediction and predictive
performance was assessed by cross-validation. Variable importance was quantified 
by Shapley values (ShapVal), permutation importance (PermImp), and accuracy gain.
Shapley dependency and interaction plots were used to evaluate the pattern of
relationships between risk factors and outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 2386 severe and 477 fatal cases were identified. For analyses
within infected individuals (n=7846), our prediction model achieved area under
the receiving-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.723 (95% CI
0.711-0.736) and 0.814 (95% CI 0.791-0.838) for severe and fatal infections,
respectively. The top 5 contributing factors (sorted by ShapVal) for severity
were age, number of drugs taken (cnt_tx), cystatin C (reflecting renal function),
waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and Townsend deprivation index (TDI). For mortality,
the top features were age, testosterone, cnt_tx, waist circumference (WC), and
red cell distribution width. For analyses involving the whole UKBB population,
AUCs for severity and fatality were 0.696 (95% CI 0.684-0.708) and 0.825 (95% CI 
0.802-0.848), respectively. The same top 5 risk factors were identified for both 
outcomes, namely, age, cnt_tx, WC, WHR, and TDI. Apart from the above, age,
cystatin C, TDI, and cnt_tx were among the top 10 across all 4 analyses. Other
diseases top ranked by ShapVal or PermImp were type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and dementia, among others. For the
"lite" models, predictive performances were broadly similar, with estimated AUCs 
of 0.716, 0.818, 0.696, and 0.830, respectively. The top ranked variables were
similar to above, including age, cnt_tx, WC, sex (male), and T2DM.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified numerous baseline clinical risk factors for
severe/fatal infection by XGboost. For example, age, central obesity, impaired
renal function, multiple comorbidities, and cardiometabolic abnormalities may
predispose to poorer outcomes. The prediction models may be useful at a
population level to identify those susceptible to developing severe/fatal
infections, facilitating targeted prevention strategies. A risk-prediction tool
is also available online. Further replications in independent cohorts are
required to verify our findings.

Medical informatics, as much as it is a result of evolution as planned
philosophy, have its roots in the history of information technology and medicine.
Development of medical informatics started in the fifties of the 20th century. In
the period after Second World War USA was the leading country in the field of
Computer science and the leader in using the first computers in medicine and
healthcare services. The development of information and communication
technologies (ICT) during the last two decades of 20th century was particularly
important for development of medical informatics, with great influence of
Internet by medical professionals at every level of health care system.
Comprehensive and essential contents on medical informatics, but also the aspects
nurtured by the main "schools of Medical informatics" - Anglo-Saxon (Abbot,
Anderson, etc.), French (Gremy, Remond, etc.), German (Reichhertz). et al.),
American (Collen, Green, et al.), Middle and East Europe (Dezelic, Masic,
Zvarova, Naszlady, Mihalas, etc.), whose terms "Health Informatics" (Abbot) and
"Medical Informatics" (Gremy and Reichertz) have entered the European and world
medical literature. For those studying the subject or working in the field, the
experiences of others who use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)
for the better of health care can provide a necessary perspective. In promotion
and spreading the knowledge and experiences of the medical informatics as
scientific and academic discipline in the world, great impact was given by IMIA
and its "branch associations" at every continent. But, most influential
association became European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI),
established on September 11th 1976 in Copenhagen with members of 10 national
representatives (Barry Barber (UK), Antonio Perens de Talens (Italy), Francois
Grémy (France), Rolf Hansen (Norway), Mogens Jorgensen (Denmark), Hans Peterson
(Sweden), Peter Leo Reichertz (Germany), Jan Roukens (Netherlands), Jan van
Egmond (Belgium) and Ilkka Vaananen (Finland) who adopted Statute of EFMI and
other documents and prepared the first MIE Conference in Cambridge (UK) in 1978. 
Today EFMI represent leading European medical informatics professional
organization representing 28 European countries and institutional members. EFMI
is organized as a non-profit organization concerned with the theory and practice 
of Information Science and Technology within the Health and Health Sciences
sector, in a European context. The goals set of EFMI are: a) To advance
international co-operation and dissemination of information in Medical
Informatics on a European basis; b) To promote high standards in the application 
of medical informatics; c) To promote research and development in medical
informatics; d) To encourage high standards in education in medical informatics; 
and e) To function as the autonomous European Regional Council of IMIA. Author of
this article described the facts about important events which EFMI, with
contribution of national societies, members of EFMI, organized during 45 years of
existence, including important facts about the influential medical informatics
experts. Finally, author shortly described important facts about history of
development of Health informatics in Bosnia and Herzegovina and South-Eastern
Europe, including facts about his activities during long period of his
participation in IMIA General Assembly and EFMI Council. There he was very
actively involved in a lot of activities, including organization of 22nd MIE
Conference in Sarajevo in 2009.

The capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) methods have expanded
significantly in recent years, and progress has been particularly driven by
advances in data science and machine learning. However, NLP is still largely
underused in patient-oriented clinical research and care (POCRC). A key reason
behind this is that clinical NLP methods are typically developed, optimized, and 
evaluated with narrowly focused data sets and tasks (eg, those for the detection 
of specific symptoms in free texts). Such research and development (R&D)
approaches may be described as problem oriented, and the developed systems
perform specialized tasks well. As standalone systems, however, they generally do
not comprehensively meet the needs of POCRC. Thus, there is often a gap between
the capabilities of clinical NLP methods and the needs of patient-facing medical 
experts. We believe that to increase the practical use of biomedical NLP, future 
R&D efforts need to be broadened to a new research paradigm-one that explicitly
incorporates characteristics that are crucial for POCRC. We present our viewpoint
about 4 such interrelated characteristics that can increase NLP systems'
suitability for POCRC (3 that represent NLP system properties and 1 associated
with the R&D process)-(1) interpretability (the ability to explain system
decisions), (2) patient centeredness (the capability to characterize diverse
patients), (3) customizability (the flexibility for adapting to distinct
settings, problems, and cohorts), and (4) multitask evaluation (the validation of
system performance based on multiple tasks involving heterogeneous data sets). By
using the NLP task of clinical concept detection as an example, we detail these
characteristics and discuss how they may result in the increased uptake of NLP
systems for POCRC.

Effective therapies for COVID-19 are still lacking, and drug repositioning is a
promising approach to address this problem. Here, we adopted a medical
informatics approach to repositioning. We leveraged a large prospective cohort,
the UK-Biobank (UKBB, N ~ 397,000), and studied associations of prior use of all 
level-4 ATC drug categories (N = 819, including vaccines) with COVID-19 diagnosis
and severity. Effects of drugs on the risk of infection, disease severity, and
mortality were investigated separately. Logistic regression was conducted,
controlling for main confounders. We observed strong and highly consistent
protective associations with statins. Many top-listed protective drugs were also 
cardiovascular medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), calcium channel blocker (CCB), and
beta-blockers. Some other drugs showing protective associations included
biguanides (metformin), estrogens, thyroid hormones, proton pump inhibitors, and 
testosterone-5-alpha reductase inhibitors, among others. We also observed
protective associations by influenza, pneumococcal, and several other vaccines.
Subgroup and interaction analyses were also conducted, which revealed differences
in protective effects in various subgroups. For example, protective effects of
flu/pneumococcal vaccines were weaker in obese individuals, while protection by
statins was stronger in cardiovascular patients. To conclude, our analysis
revealed many drug repositioning candidates, for example several cardiovascular
medications. Further studies are required for validation.

Short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences are frequently used in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine. However, STIR sequences require a
significant amount of scanning time. The purpose of the present study was to
generate virtual STIR (vSTIR) images from non-contrast, non-fat-suppressed T1-
and T2-weighted images using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN).
The training dataset comprised 612 studies from 514 patients, and the validation 
dataset comprised 141 studies from 133 patients. For validation, 100 original
STIR and respective vSTIR series were presented to six senior radiologists
(blinded for the STIR type) in independent A/B-testing sessions. Additionally,
for 141 real or vSTIR sequences, the testers were required to produce a
structured report of 15 different findings. In the A/B-test, most testers could
not reliably identify the real STIR (mean error of tester 1-6: 41%; 44%; 58%;
48%; 39%; 45%). In the evaluation of the structured reports, vSTIR was equivalent
to real STIR in 13 of 15 categories. In the category of the number of STIR
hyperintense vertebral bodies (p = 0.08) and in the diagnosis of bone metastases 
(p = 0.055), the vSTIR was only slightly insignificantly equivalent. By virtually
generating STIR images of diagnostic quality from T1- and T2-weighted images
using a cGAN, one can shorten examination times and increase throughput.

Implementation of e-health innovative technologies in North Lebanon hospitals.

Halwani J(1), Mouawad D(1).

Author information: 
(1)Lebanese University, Faculty of Public Health, Dam & Farz, Tripoli, Lebanon.

Background: E-health is considered the single most important revolution in health
care since the advent of modern medicine. It is an emerging field of medical
informatics, used in the organization and delivery of health services and
information. It is expected to improve various aspects of health care.
Aims: To achieve universal health coverage in Lebanon, and to explore e-health
implementation in Northern Lebanese hospitals and factors influencing the
adoption of recent specialized technology in e-health.
Methods: We adopted an exploratory research method based on a semi-structured
questionnaire. The main 14 hospitals in Northern Lebanon were chosen for
face-to-face interviews to assess and measure behaviour and knowledge regarding
e-health and its implementation. Data were analysed using SPSS software, followed
by SWOT analysis.
Results: The hospitals surveyed had partly implemented and continuously tried to 
apply some e-health technologies, but there were no real medical records for
patients. Various challenges were faced for full e-health technology
implementation in Lebanon: primarily cost, followed by some personnel resistance,
lack of legislation and common standards, and the necessity for continual
training.
Conclusion: The majority of hospitals are conscious of the importance of e-health
technology and the urgent need to implement these new methods. After the
legislative rules are issued, the financial aspects remain the major handicap to 
full implementation. A major role must be played by the academic institutions to 
provide appropriate education on e-health in their programmes for future
graduates.

Ciguatera poisoning is a globally occurring seafood disease caused by the
ingestion of marine products contaminated with dinoflagellate produced
neurotoxins. Persistent forms of ciguatera, which prove to be highly
debilitating, are poorly studied and represent a significant medical issue. The
present study aims to better understand chronic ciguatera manifestations and
identify potential predictive factors for their duration. Medical files of 49
patients were analyzed, and the post-hospitalization evolution of the disease
assessed through a follow-up questionnaire. A rigorous logistic lasso regression 
model was applied to select significant predictors from a list of 37 patient
characteristics potentially predictive of having chronic symptoms. Missing data
were handled by complete case analysis, and a survival analysis was implemented. 
All models used standardized variables, and multiple comparisons in the survival 
analyses were handled by Bonferroni correction. Among all studied variables, five
significant predictors of having symptoms lasting ≥3 months were identified: age,
tobacco consumption, acute bradycardia, laboratory measures of urea, and
neutrophils. This exploratory, hypothesis-generating study contributes to the
development of ciguatera epidemiology by narrowing the list from 37 possible
predictors to a list of five predictors that seem worth further investigation as 
candidate risk factors in more targeted studies of ciguatera symptom duration.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to develop and apply a framework that uses a clinical
phenotyping tool to assess risk for recurrent preterm birth.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extended an existing clinical phenotyping tool and
applied a 4-step framework for our retrospective cohort study. The study was
based on data collected in the Genomic and Proteomic Network for Preterm Birth
Research Longitudinal Cohort Study (GPN-PBR LS). A total of 52 sociodemographic, 
clinical and obstetric history-related risk factors were selected for the
analysis. Spontaneous and indicated delivery subtypes were analyzed both
individually and in combination. Chi-square analysis and Kaplan-Meier estimate
were used for univariate analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for 
multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: : A total of 428 women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth
qualified for our analysis. The predictors of preterm delivery used in
multivariable model were maternal age, maternal race, household income, marital
status, previous caesarean section, number of previous deliveries, number of
previous abortions, previous birth weight, cervical insufficiency, decidual
hemorrhage, and placental dysfunction. The models stratified by delivery subtype 
performed better than the naïve model (concordance 0.76 for the spontaneous
model, 0.87 for the indicated model, and 0.72 for the naïve model).
DISCUSSION: The proposed 4-step framework is effective to analyze risk factors
for recurrent preterm birth in a retrospective cohort and possesses practical
features for future analyses with other data sources (eg, electronic health
record data).
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an analytical framework that utilizes a clinical
phenotyping tool and performed a survival analysis to analyze risk for recurrent 
preterm birth.

Chapitre 2. L’intelligibilité des algorithmes dans les systèmes d’aide à la
décision médicale.

[Article in French]

Bernelin M, Desmoulin-Canselier S.

Advances in medical informatics and the widespread collection of patients&#8217; 
data have led to the development of new medical decision support systems. Some of
them are simply used to guide the medical practicioner, while others
automatically generate decisions. Known under various names (&#8220;expert
systems&#8221;, &#8220;decision support systems&#8221;, &#8220;medical
AI&#8221;), they can be used for diagnosis, prognosis or care. They all function 
by means of algorithms that process data. These algorithms are more or less
complex, more or less supervised, but they are also frequently opaque. Yet these 
tools are becoming increasingly important in the medical world. It seems
therefore necessary to better inform users and beneficiaries &#8211; doctors and 
patients &#8211; of their operating logic, their limits and their possible
biases. This study suggests strengthening European law (and French national law) 
on this point. A greater intelligibility of algorithms in decision support
systems would meet the ethical requirements of medical decision making and the
objective of shared medical decision making in conscience.

Management Modality in Academic, Community, and Safety-Net Settings: Qualitative 
Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Prior studies have shown that virtual reality (VR) is an efficacious 
treatment modality for opioid-sparing pain management. However, the majority of
these studies were conducted among primarily White, relatively advantaged
populations and in well-resourced settings.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a qualitative, theory-informed implementation science
study to assess the readiness for VR in safety-net settings.
METHODS: Using the theoretical lens of the Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research (CFIR) framework, we conducted semistructured interviews 
with current VR users and nonusers based in safety-net health systems (n=15). We 
investigated barriers and facilitators to a commercially available, previously
validated VR technology platform AppliedVR (Los Angeles, CA, USA). We used
deductive qualitative analysis using the overarching domains of the CFIR
framework and performed open, inductive coding to identify specific themes within
each domain.
RESULTS: Interviewees deemed the VR intervention to be useful, scalable, and an
appealing alternative to existing pain management approaches. Both users and
nonusers identified a lack of reimbursement for VR as a significant challenge for
adoption. Current users cited positive patient feedback, but safety-net
stakeholders voiced concern that existing VR content may not be relevant or
appealing to diverse patients. All respondents acknowledged the challenge of
integrating and maintaining VR in current pain management workflows across a
range of clinical settings, and this adoption challenge was particularly acute,
given resource and staffing constraints in safety-net settings.
CONCLUSIONS: VR for pain management holds interest for frontline pain management 
clinicians and leadership in safety-net health settings but will require
significant tailoring and adaption to address the needs of diverse populations.
Integration into complex workflows for pain management is a significant barrier
to adoption, and participants cited structural cost and reimbursement concerns as
impediments to initial implementation and scaling of VR use.

With the steady increase in the connectivity of the healthcare system, new
requirements and challenges are emerging. In addition to the seamless exchange of
data between service providers on a national level, the local legacy data must
also meet the new requirements. For this purpose, the applications used must be
tested securely and sufficiently. However, the availability of suitable and
realistic test data is not always given. Therefore, this study deals with the
creation of test data based on real electronic health record data provided by the
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. In addition to
converting the data to the current FHIR R4, conversion to the core data sets of
the German Medical Informatics Initiative was also presented and made available. 
The test data was generated to simulate a legacy data transfer. Moreover, four
different FHIR servers were tested for performance. This study is the first step 
toward comparable test scenarios around shared datasets and promotes
comparability among providers on a national level.

Expert systems have a long tradition in both medical informatics and artificial
intelligence research. Traditionally, such systems are created by implementing
knowledge provided by experts in a system that can be queried for answers. To
automatically generate such knowledge directly from data, the lightweight
InteKRator toolbox will be introduced here, which combines knowledge
representation and machine learning approaches. The learned knowledge is
represented in the form of rules with exceptions that can be inspected and that
are easily comprehensible. An inference module allows for the efficient answering
of queries, while at the same time offering the possibility of providing
explanations for the inference results. The learned knowledge can be revised
manually or automatically with new evidence after learning.

The primary intention of any scientific work is to share the gained knowledge and
to contribute to the knowledge and progress in the scientific domain. The wide
range of journals and conferences, each with specific submission requirements,
can be difficult to navigate, especially for young scientists without extensive
experience. But a suitable publication strategy can be helpful, especially at the
beginning of a scientific career. Using the annual conference of the German
Association for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS) e.V. as an 
example, this editorial highlights fundamental differences, advantages and
disadvantages, as well as assistance in selecting the right form of submission.

Purpose: To develop deep learning model (Deep-KOA) that can predict the risk of
knee osteoarthritis (KOA) within the next year by using the previous three years 
nonimage-based electronic medical record (EMR) data.
Patients and Methods: We randomly selected information of two million patients
from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from January 
1, 1999 to December 31, 2013. During the study period, 132,594 patients were
diagnosed with KOA, while 1,068,464 patients without KOA were chosen randomly as 
control. We constructed a feature matrix by using the three-year history of
sequential diagnoses, drug prescriptions, age, and sex. Deep learning methods of 
convolutional neural network (CNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used 
together to develop a risk prediction model. We used the area under the receiver 
operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and precision to
evaluate the performance of Deep-KOA. Then, we explored the important features
using stepwise feature selection.
Results: This study included 132,594 KOA patients, 83,111 females (62.68%),
49,483 males (37.32%), mean age 64.2 years, and 1,068,464 non-KOA patients,
545,902 females (51.09%), 522,562 males (48.91%), mean age 51.00 years. The
Deep-KOA achieved an overall AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of
0.97, 0.89, 0.93, and 0.80 respectively. The discriminative analysis of Deep-KOA 
showed important features from several diseases such as disorders of the eye and 
adnexa, acute respiratory infection, other metabolic and immunity disorders, and 
diseases of the musculoskeletal and connective tissue. Age and sex were not found
as the most discriminative features, with AUROC of 0.9593 (-0.76% loss) and
0.9644 (-0.25% loss) respectively. Whereas medications including antacid, cough
suppressant, and expectorants were identified as discriminative features.
Conclusion: Deep-KOA was developed to predict the risk of KOA within one year
earlier, which may provide clues for clinical decision support systems to target 
patients with high risk of KOA to get precision prevention program.

BACKGROUND: Treatment planning is one of the crucial stages of healthcare
assessment and delivery. Moreover, it also has a significant impact on patient
outcomes and system efficiency. With the evolution of transformative healthcare
technologies, most areas of healthcare have started collecting data at different 
levels, as a result of which there is a splurge in the size and complexity of
health data being generated every minute.
INTRODUCTION: This paper explores the different characteristics of health data
with respect to big data. Besides this, it also classifies research efforts in
treatment planning on the basis of the informatics domain being used, which
include medical informatics, imaging informatics and translational
bioinformatics.
METHOD: This is a survey paper that reviews existing literature on the use of big
data technologies for treatment planning in the healthcare ecosystem. Therefore, 
a qualitative research methodology was adopted for this work.
RESULT: Review of existing literature has been analyzed to identify potential
gaps in research, identifying and providing insights into high prospect areas for
potential future research.
CONCLUSION: Use of big data for treatment planning is rapidly evolving and
findings of this research can head start and streamline specific research
pathways in the field.

Models Predicting Hospital Admission of Adult Patients Utilizing Prehospital
Data: Systematic Review Using PROBAST and CHARMS.

BACKGROUND: Emergency department boarding and hospital exit block are primary
causes of emergency department crowding and have been conclusively associated
with poor patient outcomes and major threats to patient safety. Boarding occurs
when a patient is delayed or blocked from transitioning out of the emergency
department because of dysfunctional transition or bed assignment processes.
Predictive models for estimating the probability of an occurrence of this type
could be useful in reducing or preventing emergency department boarding and
hospital exit block, to reduce emergency department crowding.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify and appraise the predictive
performance, predictor utility, model application, and model utility of hospital 
admission prediction models that utilized prehospital, adult patient data and
aimed to address emergency department crowding.
METHODS: We searched multiple databases for studies, from inception to September 
30, 2019, that evaluated models predicting adult patients' imminent hospital
admission, with prehospital patient data and regression analysis. We used PROBAST
(Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool) and CHARMS (Checklist for
Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction
Modeling Studies) to critically assess studies.
RESULTS: Potential biases were found in most studies, which suggested that each
model's predictive performance required further investigation. We found that
select prehospital patient data contribute to the identification of patients
requiring hospital admission. Biomarker predictors may add superior value and
advantages to models. It is, however, important to note that no models had been
integrated with an information system or workflow, operated independently as
electronic devices, or operated in real time within the care environment. Several
models could be used at the site-of-care in real time without digital devices,
which would make them suitable for low-technology or no-electricity environments.
CONCLUSIONS: There is incredible potential for prehospital admission prediction
models to improve patient care and hospital operations. Patient data can be
utilized to act as predictors and as data-driven, actionable tools to identify
patients likely to require imminent hospital admission and reduce patient
boarding and crowding in emergency departments. Prediction models can be used to 
justify earlier patient admission and care, to lower morbidity and mortality, and
models that utilize biomarker predictors offer additional advantages.

Objectives: To share our approach for designing, developing, and deploying the
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) Mobile Application, details about its
dissemination and support through the REDCap Consortium, and a set of lessons
learned and guidance recommendations for others developing mobile platforms to
support research in regions or situations with internet scarcity.
Materials and Methods: We defined minimum viable product requirements centered
around Android and iOS platform availability, data capture specifications and
project initiation workflow, study data synchronization, and data security. After
launch, we added features based on feedback from end-users and REDCap
administrators. We prioritized new features based on expected impact, difficulty,
and anticipated long-term cost for sustainability.
Results: We chose Apache Cordova, a combined iOS and Android development
framework, based on targeted end-user technology expectations, available
programmer resources, and the need to provide solutions for resource-limited
settings. The REDCap Mobile Application was launched in 2015, has been enabled at
over 800 REDCap Consortium partner organizations, and has supported diverse
scientific studies around the world.
Discussion: Apache Cordova enabled early software releases for both iOS and
Android, but required ongoing optimization efforts to improve software
responsiveness. Developing a robust and efficient mobile device synchronization
architecture was difficult without direct access to global network
infrastructures for testing. Research teams in sub-Saharan Africa helped our
development team understand and simulate real-world scenarios of intermittent
internet connectivity.
Conclusion: Guidance recommendations based on designing, developing, deploying,
and disseminating the REDCap Mobile Application may help other teams looking to
develop clinical research informatics applications.

BACKGROUND: The prescription system known as RELE is the electronic prescribing
and dispensing system that has been used by the Balearic Islands Health Service
(IB-SALUT, Spain) since April 2006. This repository contains patients'
computerised medication profiles (CMPs). Data from studies conducted in other
settings have shown the existence of discrepancies between the medications
recorded in patients' CMPs and the medications actually taken by the patients.
METHODS: Chronic medications recorded in RELE CMPs were compared with those
obtained through a structured clinical interview with patients or the persons
responsible for the administration of the patients' medications. A descriptive
analysis of each discrepancy was performed. Potentially associated factors were
analysed using Pearson's χ2 test.
RESULTS: Of the 215 CMPs studied, 168 (78%) had discrepancies. The rate of
discrepancies in the general population inferred from these results ranged from
72.57% to 83.71%, with a 95% confidence level. Polypharmacy was associated with
the presence of discrepancies (χ2: 39.998, 1 df, p<0.0001) as well as patient age
>65 years (χ2: 18.949, 2df, p<0.0001) and higher comorbidity (χ2: 12.548, 2 df,
p=0.002). The association between the types of discrepancies and their causes
showed that prescriber-generated dosage errors were the most common errors
(n=116; 27%), followed by patient-generated commissions (n=79; 18%),
patient-generated dosage errors (n=77; 18%) and prescriber-generated commissions 
(n=73; 17%).
CONCLUSION: The rate of discrepancies identified in this study shows that
clinical interviews with patients during transitions of care continue to be
essential.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated efficient and accurate
triaging of patients for more effective allocation of resources and treatment.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives are to investigate parameters and risk stratification 
tools that can be applied to predict mortality within 90 days of hospital
admission in patients with COVID-19.
METHODS: A literature search of original studies assessing systems and parameters
predicting mortality of patients with COVID-19 was conducted using MEDLINE and
EMBASE.
RESULTS: 589 titles were screened, and 76 studies were found investigating the
prognostic ability of 16 existing scoring systems (area under the receiving
operator curve (AUROC) range: 0.550-0.966), 38 newly developed COVID-19-specific 
prognostic systems (AUROC range: 0.6400-0.9940), 15 artificial intelligence (AI) 
models (AUROC range: 0.840-0.955) and 16 studies on novel blood parameters and
imaging.
DISCUSSION: Current scoring systems generally underestimate mortality, with the
highest AUROC values found for APACHE II and the lowest for SMART-COP. Systems
featuring heavier weighting on respiratory parameters were more predictive than
those assessing other systems. Cardiac biomarkers and CT chest scans were the
most commonly studied novel parameters and were independently associated with
mortality, suggesting potential for implementation into model development. All
types of AI modelling systems showed high abilities to predict mortality,
although none had notably higher AUROC values than COVID-19-specific prediction
models. All models were found to have bias, including lack of prospective
studies, small sample sizes, single-centre data collection and lack of external
validation.
CONCLUSION: The single parameters established within this review would be useful 
to look at in future prognostic models in terms of the predictive capacity their 
combined effect may harness.

The limited volume of COVID-19 data from Africa raises concerns for global genome
research, which requires a diversity of genotypes for accurate disease
prediction, including on the provenance of the new SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The
Virus Outbreak Data Network (VODAN)-Africa studied the possibility of increasing 
the production of clinical data, finding concerns about data ownership, and the
limited use of health data for quality treatment at point of care. To address
this, VODAN Africa developed an architecture to record clinical health data and
research data collected on the incidence of COVID-19, producing these as human-
and machine-readable data objects in a distributed architecture of locally
governed, linked, human- and machine-readable data. This architecture supports
analytics at the point of care and-through data visiting, across facilities-for
generic analytics. An algorithm was run across FAIR Data Points to visit the
distributed data and produce aggregate findings. The FAIR data architecture is
deployed in Uganda, Ethiopia, Liberia, Nigeria, Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania,
Zimbabwe, and Tunisia.

OBJECTIVE: Contact tracing of reported infections could enable close contacts to 
be identified, tested, and quarantined for controlling further spread. This
strategy has been well demonstrated in the surveillance and control of COVID-19
(coronavirus disease 2019) epidemics. This study aims to leverage contact tracing
data to investigate the degree of spread and the formation of transmission
cascades composing of multiple clusters.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm on mining relationships between clusters for 
network analysis is proposed with 3 steps: horizontal edge creation, vertical
edge consolidation, and graph reduction. The constructed network was then
analyzed with information diffusion metrics and exponential-family random graph
modeling. With categorization of clusters by exposure setting, the metrics were
compared among cascades to identify associations between exposure settings and
their network positions within the cascade using Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Experimental results illustrated that transmission cascades containing
or seeded by daily activity clusters spread faster while those containing social 
activity clusters propagated farther. Cascades involving work or study
environments consisted of more clusters, which had a higher transmission range
and scale. Social activity clusters were more likely to be connected, whereas
both residence and healthcare clusters did not preferentially link to clusters
belonging to the same exposure setting.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm could contribute to in-depth epidemiologic
investigation of infectious disease transmission to support targeted
nonpharmaceutical intervention policies for COVID-19 epidemic control.

BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records (EMRs) are widely used, but in many cases,
they are used within a network physically separated from the Internet.
Multicenter clinical studies use Internet-connected electronic data capture (EDC)
systems to collect data, where data entered into the EMR are manually transcribed
into the EDC system. In addition, medical images for clinical research are also
collected manually. Variations in EMRs and differing data structures among
vendors hamper the use of data for clinical research.
METHODS: We solved this problem by developing a network infrastructure for
clinical research between Osaka University Hospital and affiliated hospitals in
the Osaka area and introducing a clinical data collection system (CDCS). In each 
hospital's EMR network, we implemented a CRF reporter that accumulated data for
clinical research using a template and then sent the data to a management server 
in the Osaka University Hospital Data Center. To organize the patient profile
data and clinical laboratory data stored in each EMR for use in clinical
research, the data are retrieved from the template by an interface module
developed by each vendor, according to our common data output interface
specification. The data entered into the CRF reporter template for clinical
research are also recorded in the EMR progress notes and sent to the data
management server. This network infrastructure can also be used as a medical
image collection system that automatically collects images for research from PACS
at each hospital. These systems are managed under common subject numbers issued
by the CDCS.
RESULTS: A network infrastructure was established among 19 hospitals, and a CRF
reporter was incorporated into the EMR. A medical image transfer system was
introduced in 13 hospitals. Since 2013, 28 clinical studies have been conducted
using this system, and data for 9,987 cases have been collected as of December
31, 2020.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating a CRF reporter with medical image transfer system into 
the EMR has proven useful for collecting research data.

BACKGROUND: Journey mapping involves the creation of visual narrative timelines
depicting the multidimensional relationship between a consumer and a service. The
use of journey maps in medical research is a novel and innovative approach to
understanding patient healthcare encounters.
OBJECTIVES: To determine possible applications of journey mapping in medical
research and the clinical setting. Specialist palliative care services were
selected as the model to evaluate this paradigm, as there are numerous evidence
gaps and inconsistencies in the delivery of care that may be addressed using this
tool.
METHODS: A purposive convenience sample of specialist palliative care providers
from the Supportive and Palliative Care unit of a major Australian tertiary
health service were invited to evaluate journey maps illustrating the final year 
of life of inpatient palliative care patients. Sixteen maps were purposively
selected from a sample of 104 consecutive patients. This study utilised a
qualitative mixed-methods approach, incorporating a modified Delphi technique and
thematic analysis in an online questionnaire.
RESULTS: Our thematic and Delphi analyses were congruent, with consensus findings
consistent with emerging themes. Journey maps provided a holistic patient-centred
perspective of care that characterised healthcare interactions within a
longitudinal trajectory. Through these journey maps, participants were able to
identify barriers to effective palliative care and opportunities to improve care 
delivery by observing patterns of patient function and healthcare encounters over
multiple settings.
CONCLUSIONS: This unique qualitative study noted many promising applications of
the journey mapping suitable for extrapolation outside of the palliative care
setting as a review and audit tool, or a mechanism for providing proactive
patient-centred care. This is particularly significant as machine learning and
big data is increasingly applied to healthcare.

Bordeaux, France.

OBJECTIVES: To introduce and analyse current trends in Public Health and
Epidemiology Informatics.
METHODS: PubMed search of 2020 literature on public health and epidemiology
informatics was conducted and all retrieved references were reviewed by the two
section editors. Then, 15 candidate best papers were selected among the 920
references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by the two section editors, two 
chief editors, and external reviewers, including at least two senior faculty, to 
allow the Editorial Committee of the 2021 International Medical Informatics
Association (IMIA) Yearbook to make an informed decision regarding the selection 
of the best papers.
RESULTS: Among the 920 references retrieved from PubMed, four were suggested as
best papers and the first three were finally selected. The fourth paper was
excluded because of reproducibility issues. The first best paper is a very public
health focused paper with health informatics and biostatistics methods applied to
stratify patients within a cohort in order to identify those at risk of suicide; 
the second paper describes the use of a randomized design to test the likely
impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-management
elements, on patient consultations or antibiotic requests for influenza-like
illnesses. The third selected paper evaluates the perception among communities of
routine use of Whole Genome Sequencing and Big Data technologies to capture more 
detailed and specific personal information.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from the three studies suggest that using Public Health
and Epidemiology Informatics methods could leverage, when combined with Deep
Learning, early interventions and appropriate treatments to mitigate suicide
risk. Further, they also demonstrate that well informing and empowering patients 
could help them to be involved more in their care process.

OBJECTIVES: Provide an overview of the emerging themes and notable papers which
were published in 2020 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational
Informatics (BTI) for the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook.
METHODS: A team of 16 individuals scanned the literature from the past year.
Using a scoring rubric, papers were evaluated on their novelty, importance, and
objective quality. 1,224 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms extracted from
these papers were used to identify themes and research focuses. The authors then 
used the scoring results to select notable papers and trends presented in this
manuscript.
RESULTS: The search phase identified 263 potential papers and central themes of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), machine learning, and bioinformatics were
examined in greater detail.
CONCLUSIONS: When addressing a once in a centruy pandemic, scientists worldwide
answered the call, with informaticians playing a critical role. Productivity and 
innovations reached new heights in both TBI and science, but significant research
gaps remain.

Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.
(3)AP-HP, DRCI, Paris, France.

OBJECTIVE: To select, present and summarize some of the best papers in the field 
of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) published in 2020.
METHODS: A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics
literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published
in 2020, based on PubMed queries. This review was conducted according to the IMIA
Yearbook guidelines.
RESULTS: Four best papers were selected among 1,175 publications. In contrast
with the papers selected last year, the four best papers of 2020 demonstrated a
significant focus on methods and tools for ontology curation and design. The
usual KRM application domains (bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronic
health records) were also represented.
CONCLUSION: In 2020, ontology curation emerges as a significant topic of research
interest. Bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronics health records remain
significant research areas in the KRM community with various applications.
Knowledge representations are key to advance machine learning by providing
context and to develop novel bioinformatics metrics. As in 2019, representations 
serve a great variety of applications across many medical domains, with
actionable results and now with growing adhesion to the open science initiative.

Contributions from 2020.

Borbolla D(1), Ficheur G(2); Section Editors for the IMIA Yearbook Section on
Decision Support.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 
USA.
(2)Univ. Lille, CHU Lille, ULR 2694 - METRICS, Public health dept, Lille, France.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize research contributions published in 2020 in the field of
clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order entry
(CPOE), and select the best papers for the Decision Support section of the
International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook 2021.
METHODS: Two bibliographic databases were searched for papers referring to
clinical decision support systems. From search results, section editors
established a list of candidate best papers, which were then peer-reviewed by
seven external reviewers. The IMIA Yearbook editorial committee finally selected 
the best papers on the basis of all reviews including the section editors'
evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 1,919 articles were retrieved. 15 best paper candidates were 
selected, the reviews of which resulted in the selection of two best papers. One 
paper reports on the use of electronic health records to support a public health 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The second paper proposes
a combination of CDSS and telemedicine as a technology-based intervention to
improve the outcomes of depression as part of a cluster trial.
CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the number and the variety of works related to clinical 
decision support, research in the field is very active. This year's selection
highlighted the application of CDSS to fight COVID-19 and a combined
technology-based strategy to improve the treatment of depression.

(3)Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics of TU Braunschweig and
Hannover Medical School, Braunschweig, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To identify and highlight research papers representing noteworthy
developments in signals, sensors, and imaging informatics in 2020.
METHOD: A broad literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases.
We combined Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords to construct
particular queries for sensors, signals, and image informatics. We only
considered papers that have been published in journals providing at least three
articles in the query response. Section editors then independently reviewed the
titles and abstracts of preselected papers assessed on a three-point Likert
scale. Papers were rated from 1 (do not include) to 3 (should be included) for
each topical area (sensors, signals, and imaging informatics) and those with an
average score of 2 or above were subsequently read and assessed again by two of
the three co-editors. Finally, the top 14 papers with the highest combined scores
were considered based on consensus.
RESULTS: The search for papers was executed in January 2021. After removing
duplicates and conference proceedings, the query returned a set of 101, 193, and 
529 papers for sensors, signals, and imaging informatics, respectively. We
filtered out journals that had less than three papers in the query results,
reducing the number of papers to 41, 117, and 333, respectively. From these, the 
co-editors identified 22 candidate papers with more than 2 Likert points on
average, from which 14 candidate best papers were nominated after intensive
discussion. At least five external reviewers then rated the remaining papers. The
four finalist papers were found using the composite rating of all external
reviewers. These best papers were approved by consensus of the International
Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board.
CONCLUSIONS: Sensors, signals, and imaging informatics is a dynamic field of
intense research. The four best papers represent advanced approaches for
combining, processing, modeling, and analyzing heterogeneous sensor and imaging
data. The selected papers demonstrate the combination and fusion of multiple
sensors and sensor networks using electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram
(EEG), or photoplethysmogram (PPG) with advanced data processing, deep and
machine learning techniques, and present image processing modalities beyond
state-of-the-art that significantly support and further improve medical decision 
making.

Clinical Information Systems.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Medical Informatics, UMIT - Private University for Health
Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall in Tirol, Austria.
(2)Medical Technologies Department, MCI - The Entrepreneurial School, Innsbruck, 
Austria.

OBJECTIVE: In this synopsis, we give an overview of recent research and propose a
selection of best papers published in 2020 in the field of Clinical Information
Systems (CIS).
METHOD: As CIS section editors, we annually apply a systematic process to
retrieve articles for the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook 
of Medical Informatics. For seven years now, we use the same query to find
relevant publications in the CIS field. Each year we retrieve more than 2,400
papers which we categorize in a multi-pass review to distill a preselection of 15
candidate papers. External reviewers and yearbook editors then assess the
selected candidate papers. Based on the review results, the IMIA Yearbook
editorial board chooses up to four best publications for the section at a
selection meeting. To get an overview of the content of the retrieved articles,
we use text mining and term co-occurrence mapping techniques.
RESULTS: We carried out the query in mid-January 2021 and retrieved a
deduplicated result set of 2,787 articles from 1,135 different journals. We
nominated 15 papers as candidates and finally selected four of them as the best
papers in the CIS section. As in the previous years, the content analysis of the 
articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by CIS research. Thus,
this year we could observe a significant impact of COVID-19 on CIS research.
CONCLUSIONS: The trends in CIS research, as seen in recent years, continue to be 
observable. What was very visible was the impact of the Corona Virus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic, which has affected not only our lives but also CIS.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize significant research contributions on managing pandemics 
with health informatics published in 2020.
METHODS: An extensive search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify
peer-reviewed articles published in 2020 that examined health informatics systems
used during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The selection process comprised three
steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section
editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams
reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best
papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the International Medical
Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook.
RESULTS: Selected best papers represent the important and diverse ways that
health informatics supported clinical and public health responses to the global
COVID-19 pandemic. Selected papers represent four groups of papers: 1) Use of
analytics to screen, triage, and manage patients; 2) Use of telehealth and remote
monitoring to manage patients and populations; 3) Use of EHR systems and
administrative systems to manage internal operations of a hospital or health
system; and 4) Use of informatics methods and systems by public health
authorities to capture, store, manage, and visualize population-level data and
information.
CONCLUSION: Health informatics played a critical role in managing patients and
populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care and public health
organizations both leveraged available information systems and standards to
rapidly identify cases, triage infected individuals, and monitor population
trends. The selected best papers represent a fraction of the body of knowledge
stemming from COVID-19, most of which is focused on pandemic response. Future
work will be needed to help the world recover from the pandemic and strengthen
the health information infrastructure in preparation for the next pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: To introduce the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association
(IMIA) Yearbook by the editors.
METHODS: The editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2021 IMIA
Yearbook whose special topic is "Managing Pandemics with Health Informatics -
Successes and Challenges". The Special Topic, the keynote paper, and survey
papers are discussed. The IMIA President's statement and the IMIA dialogue with
the World Health Organization are introduced. The sections' changes in the
Yearbook Editorial Committee are also described.
RESULTS: Health informatics, in the context of a global pandemic, led to the
development of ways to collect, standardize, disseminate and reuse data
worldwide: public health data but also information from social networks and
scientific literature. Fact checking methods were mostly based on artificial
intelligence and natural language processing. The pandemic also introduced new
challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Next generation 
sequencing in bioinformatics helped in decoding the sequence of the virus and the
development of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shows the need for
timely, reliable, open, and globally available information to support decision
making and efficiently control outbreaks. Applying Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) requirements for data is a key success factor 
while challenging ethical issues have to be considered.

BACKGROUND: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) maps relationships between
and within >100 biomedical vocabularies, including Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes, creating a powerful knowledge resource which can accelerate clinical
research.
METHODS: We used synonymy and concepts relating hierarchical structure of CPT
codes within the UMLS, (1) guiding surgical experts in expanding the Operative
Stress Score (OSS) from 565 originally rated CPT codes to additional, 1,853
related procedures; (2) establishing validity of the association between the
added OSS ratings and 30-day outcomes in VASQIP (2015-2018).
RESULTS: The UMLS Metathesaurus and Semantic Network was converted into an
interactive graph database (https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/UMLS-Graph) delineating 
ontology relatedness. From this UMLS-graph, the CPT hierarchy was queried
obtaining all paths from each code to the hierarchical apex. Of 1,853 added
ratings, 43% and 76% were siblings and cousins of original OSS CPT codes. Of
857,577 VASQIP cases (mean age, 64±11years; 91% male; 75% white), 786,122 (92%)
and 71,455 (8%) were rated in the original and added OSS. Compared to original,
added OSS cases included more females (14% versus 9%) and frail patients (25%
versus 19%) undergoing high stress procedures (11% versus 8%; all P <.001).
Postoperative mortality consistently increased with OSS. Very low stress
procedures had <0.5% (original, 0.4% [95%CI, 0.4%-0.5%] versus added, 0.9%
[95%CI, 0.6%-1.2%]) and very high 3.8% (original, 3.5% [95%CI, 3.0%-4.0%] versus 
added, 5.8% [95%CI, 4.6-7.3%]) mortality rates.
CONCLUSIONS: The synonymy and concepts relating biomedical data within the UMLS
can be abstracted and efficiently used to expand the utility of existing clinical
research tools.

The advances in eHealth have dramatically changed the face of healthcare delivery
around the world, with Sub-Saharan Africa being no exception. It is essential to 
identify the prominent, emerging researchers, successful areas of research within
the field of health informatics (HI) and telemedicine (TM) to be duplicated where
there is a need. This study gives a bibliometric overview of original research
articles on medical informatics and telemedicine indexed in Scopus, PubMed, and
Science Direct over the last 20 years in sub-Saharan Africa. Keywords related to 
health informatics and telemedicine were used to retrieve relevant literature. We
specifically analyzed the evolution, standard metrics, domains of medical
informatics (MI) and TM in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Brazil, Russia, India,
China, and South Africa (BRIC) nations. Our results identified mhealth as the
main field of research in telemedicine that has seen significant growth in both
BRIC and SSA nations and is poised to be the focus of research activity in the
near future. Research production in mhealth and telemedicine showed a
considerable increase from 1999-2018. The production was dominated by articles
from South Africa in Africa and China from the BRIC nations. Most prolific
authors have resources and are leaders of health informatics projects. The
production came from 26 sub-Saharan African countries, denoting this field's
devotion in different areas around sub-Sahara. Research in mhealth needs to be
encouraged, mostly in the fight against infectious and non-infectious diseases in
sub-Saharan Africa, where technology can improve health services and decrease
disease burden.

INTRODUCTION: Narrative clinical guidelines often contain assumptions, knowledge 
gaps, and ambiguities that make translation into an electronic computable format 
difficult. This can lead to divergence in electronic implementations, reducing
the usefulness of collected data outside of that implementation setting. This
work set out to evolve guidelines-based data dictionaries by mapping to HL7 Fast 
Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and semantic terminology, thus
progressing toward machine-readable guidelines that define the minimum data set
required to support family planning and sexually transmitted infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data dictionaries were first structured to facilitate
mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies, including ICD-10, SNOMED-CT, LOINC,
and RxNorm. FHIR resources and codes were assigned to data dictionary terms. The 
data dictionary and mappings were used as inputs for a newly developed tool to
generate FHIR implementation guides.
RESULTS: Implementation guides for core data requirements for family planning and
sexually transmitted infections were created. These implementation guides display
data dictionary content as FHIR resources and semantic terminology codes.
Challenges included the use of a two-dimensional spreadsheet to facilitate
mapping, the need to create FHIR profiles and resource extensions, and applying
FHIR to a data dictionary that was created with a user interface in mind.
CONCLUSIONS: Authoring FHIR implementation guides is a complex and evolving
practice, and there are limited examples for this groundbreaking work. Moving
toward machine-readable guidelines by mapping to FHIR and semantic terminologies 
requires a thorough understanding of the context and use of terminology, an
applied information model, and other strategies for optimizing the creation and
long-term management of implementation guides. Next steps for this work include
validation and, eventually, real-world application. The process for creating the 
data dictionary and for generating implementation guides should also be improved 
to prepare for this expanding work.
FUNDING: This work was supported by the World Health Organization, which also
worked as a collaborative partner throughout the study.

BACKGROUND: There is widespread agreement on the promise of patient-facing
digital health tools to transform health care. Yet, few tools are in widespread
use or have documented clinical effectiveness.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the gap between the
potential of patient-facing digital health tools and real-world uptake.
METHODS: We interviewed and surveyed experts (in total, n=24) across key digital 
health stakeholder groups-venture capitalists, digital health companies, payers, 
and health care system providers or leaders-guided by the Consolidated Framework 
for Implementation Research.
RESULTS: Our findings revealed that external policy, regulatory demands, internal
organizational workflow, and integration needs often take priority over patient
needs and patient preferences for digital health tools, which lowers patient
acceptance rates. We discovered alignment, across all 4 stakeholder groups, in
the desire to engage both patients and frontline health care providers in broader
dissemination and evaluation of digital health tools. However, major areas of
misalignment between stakeholder groups have stymied the progress of digital
health tool uptake-venture capitalists and companies focused on external policy
and regulatory demands, while payers and providers focused on internal
organizational workflow and integration needs.
CONCLUSIONS: Misalignment of the priorities of digital health companies and their
funders with those of providers and payers requires direct attention to improve
uptake of patient-facing digital health tools and platforms.

BACKGROUND: Many research initiatives aim at using data from electronic health
records (EHRs) in observational studies. Participating sites of the German
Medical Informatics Initiative (MII) established data integration centers to
integrate EHR data within research data repositories to support local and
federated analyses. To address concerns regarding possible data quality (DQ)
issues of hospital routine data compared with data specifically collected for
scientific purposes, we have previously presented a data quality assessment (DQA)
tool providing a standardized approach to assess DQ of the research data
repositories at the MIRACUM consortium's partner sites.
OBJECTIVES: Major limitations of the former approach included manual
interpretation of the results and hard coding of analyses, making their expansion
to new data elements and databases time-consuming and error prone. We here
present an enhanced version of the DQA tool by linking it to common data element 
definitions stored in a metadata repository (MDR), adopting the harmonized DQA
framework from Kahn et al and its application within the MIRACUM consortium.
METHODS: Data quality checks were consequently aligned to a harmonized DQA
terminology. Database-specific information were systematically identified and
represented in an MDR. Furthermore, a structured representation of logical
relations between data elements was developed to model plausibility-statements in
the MDR.
RESULTS: The MIRACUM DQA tool was linked to data element definitions stored in a 
consortium-wide MDR. Additional databases used within MIRACUM were linked to the 
DQ checks by extending the respective data elements in the MDR with the required 
information. The evaluation of DQ checks was automated. An adaptable software
implementation is provided with the R package DQAstats.
CONCLUSION: The enhancements of the DQA tool facilitate the future integration of
new data elements and make the tool scalable to other databases and data models. 
It has been provided to all ten MIRACUM partners and was successfully deployed
and integrated into their respective data integration center infrastructure.

AIMS: The levels of abstraction, vast vocabulary and high cognitive load present 
significant challenges in undergraduate histopathology education.
Self-determination theory describes three psychological needs which promote
intrinsic motivation. This paper describes, evaluates and justifies a remotely
conducted, post-COVID-19 histopathology placement designed to foster intrinsic
motivation.
METHODS: 90 fourth-year medical students took part in combined synchronous and
asynchronous remote placements integrating virtual microscopy into complete
patient narratives through Google Classroom, culminating in remote, simulated
multidisciplinary team meeting sessions allowing participants to vote on 'red
flag' signs and symptoms, investigations, histological diagnoses, staging and
management of simulated virtual patients. The placement was designed to foster
autonomy, competence and relatedness, generating authenticity, transdisciplinary 
integration and clinical relevance. A postpositivistic evaluation was undertaken 
with a validated preplacement and postplacement questionnaire capturing
quantitative and qualitative data.
RESULTS: There was a significant (p<0.001) improvement in interest, confidence
and competence in histopathology. Clinical integration and relevance, access to
interactive resources and collaborative learning promoted engagement and
sustainability post-COVID-19. Barriers to online engagement included participant 
lack of confidence and self-awareness in front of peers.
CONCLUSIONS: Fostering autonomy, competence and relatedness in post-COVID-19,
remote educational designs can promote intrinsic motivation and authentic
educational experiences. Ensuring transdisciplinary clinical integration, the
appropriate use of novel technology and a focus on patient narratives can
underpin the relevance of undergraduate histopathology education. The
presentation of normal and diseased tissue in this way can serve as an important 
mode for the acquisition and application of clinically relevant knowledge
expected of graduates.

High-quality research is essential in guiding evidence-based care, and should be 
reported in a way that is reproducible, transparent and where appropriate,
provide sufficient detail for inclusion in future meta-analyses. Reporting
guidelines for various study designs have been widely used for clinical (and
preclinical) studies, consisting of checklists with a minimum set of points for
inclusion. With the recent rise in volume of research using artificial
intelligence (AI), additional factors need to be evaluated, which do not neatly
conform to traditional reporting guidelines (eg, details relating to technical
algorithm development). In this review, reporting guidelines are highlighted to
promote awareness of essential content required for studies evaluating AI
interventions in healthcare. These include published and in progress extensions
to well-known reporting guidelines such as Standard Protocol Items:
Recommendations for Interventional Trials-AI (study protocols), Consolidated
Standards of Reporting Trials-AI (randomised controlled trials), Standards for
Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-AI (diagnostic accuracy studies) and
Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual
Prognosis Or Diagnosis-AI (prediction model studies). Additionally there are a
number of guidelines that consider AI for health interventions more generally
(eg, Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM), minimum
information (MI)-CLAIM, MI for Medical AI Reporting) or address a specific
element such as the 'learning curve' (Developmental and Exploratory Clinical
Investigation of Decision-AI) . Economic evaluation of AI health interventions is
not currently addressed, and may benefit from extension to an existing guideline.
In the face of a rapid influx of studies of AI health interventions, reporting
guidelines help ensure that investigators and those appraising studies consider
both the well-recognised elements of good study design and reporting, while also 
adequately addressing new challenges posed by AI-specific elements.

OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic response at MUSC included virtual care visits
for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The telehealth system used for 
these visits only exports a text note to integrate with the EHR, but structured
and coded information about COVID-19 (e.g., exposure, risk factors, symptoms) was
needed to support clinical care and early research as well as predictive
analytics for data-driven patient advising and pooled testing.
METHODS: To capture COVID-19 information from multiple sources, a new data mart
and a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) application prototype were developed.
The NLP application combined reused components with dictionaries and rules
crafted by domain experts. It was deployed as a web service for hourly processing
of new data from patients assessed or treated for COVID-19. The extracted
information was then used to develop algorithms predicting SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic 
test results based on symptoms and exposure information.
RESULTS: The dedicated data mart and NLP application were developed and deployed 
in a mere 10-day sprint in March 2020. The NLP application was evaluated with
good accuracy (85.8% recall and 81.5% precision). The SARS-CoV-2 testing
predictive analytics algorithms were configured to provide patients with
data-driven COVID-19 testing advices with a sensitivity of 81-92% and to enable
pooled testing with a negative predictive value of 90-91% reducing the required
tests to about 63%.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 testing predictive analytics and NLP successfully enabled 
data-driven patient advising and pooled testing.

OBJECTIVE: To develop prediction models for intensive care unit (ICU) vs non-ICU 
level-of-care need within 24 hours of inpatient admission for emergency
department (ED) patients using electronic health record data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using records of 41 654 ED visits to a tertiary academic
center from 2015 to 2019, we tested 4 algorithms-feed-forward neural networks,
regularized regression, random forests, and gradient-boosted trees-to predict ICU
vs non-ICU level-of-care within 24 hours and at the 24th hour following
admission. Simple-feature models included patient demographics, Emergency
Severity Index (ESI), and vital sign summary. Complex-feature models added all
vital signs, lab results, and counts of diagnosis, imaging, procedures,
medications, and lab orders.
RESULTS: The best-performing model, a gradient-boosted tree using a full feature 
set, achieved an AUROC of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.87-0.89) and AUPRC of 0.65 (95%CI:
0.63-0.68) for predicting ICU care need within 24 hours of admission. The
logistic regression model using ESI achieved an AUROC of 0.67 (95%CI: 0.65-0.70) 
and AUPRC of 0.37 (95%CI: 0.35-0.40). Using a discrimination threshold, such as
0.6, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, and
specificity were 85%, 89%, 30%, and 99%, respectively. Vital signs were the most 
important predictors.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Undertriaging admitted ED patients who subsequently
require ICU care is common and associated with poorer outcomes. Machine learning 
models using readily available electronic health record data predict subsequent
need for ICU admission with good discrimination, substantially better than the
benchmarking ESI system. The results could be used in a multitiered clinical
decision-support system to improve ED triage.

In the epidemiological COVID-19 research, artificial intelligence is a unique
approach to make predictions about disease severity to manage COVID-19 patients. 
A limitation of artificial intelligence is, however, the high risk of bias. We
investigated the skill of data mining and machine learning, two advanced forms of
artificial intelligence, to predict severe COVID-19 pneumonia based on routine
laboratory tests. A sample of 4009 COVID-19 patients was divided into Severe
(PaO2< 60 mmHg, 489 cases) and Non-Severe (PaO2 ≥ 60 mmHg, 3520 cases) groups
according to blood hypoxemia on admission and their laboratory datasets analyzed 
by the R software and WEKA workbench. After curation, data were processed for the
selection of the most influential features including hemogram, pCO2, blood
acid-base balance, prothrombin time, inflammation biomarkers, and glucose. The
best fit of variables was successfully confirmed by either the Multilayer
Perceptron, a feedforward neural network algorithm that performed machine
recognition of severe COVID-19 with 96.5% precision, or by the C4.5 software, a
supervised learning algorithm based on an objective-predefined variable
(severity) that generated a decision tree with 89.4% precision. Finally, a
complex bivariate Pearson's correlation matrix combined with advanced
hierarchical clustering (dendrograms) were conducted for knowledge discovery. The
hidden structure of the datasets revealed shift patterns related to the
development of COVID-19-induced pneumonia that involved the
lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein and leukocyte-to-C-protein ratios, neutrophil %,
pH and pCO2. The data mining approaches to the hematological fluctuations
associated with severe COVID-19 pneumonia could not only anticipate adverse
clinical outcomes, but also reveal putative therapeutic targets.

Background: Worldwide educational programs face the challenge how to define and
integrate digital competencies in medical education. This article describes the
implementation of learning outcomes with respect to digital competencies in the
compulsory curriculum at Hannover Medical School (MHH).
Methods: An interdisciplinary MHH project group was constituted consisting of
physicians and experts in medical informatics and in curriculum development. Over
the course of 7 work sessions the group compared different international and
national frameworks dealing with digital competencies for physicians. By a
consensus driven approach the working group drew up a collection of learning
outcomes which were regarded relevant to be incorporated in the curriculum at
MHH.
Results: The analysis of different frameworks indicated that data literacy is a
central domain within all viewed preexisting catalogs. During the course of the
project group analysis, 57 learning outcomes with respect to digital competencies
were identified as necessary to be integrated in the compulsory curriculum. They 
were divided in 5 main categories: "handling of medical data," "the digital
infrastructure of the health system," "scope of application: usage in patient
care and in the field of preventive medicine," "medico-legal and ethical basics,"
and "transformation processes in medicine due to digitalization."
Conclusions: The MHH project group concluded that medical students should be
taught digital competencies that enable an understanding of underlying functional
principles of digital systems rather than their correct utilization. The
presented project indicates that a close interdisciplinary collaboration of
physicians and medical informaticians can be a promising approach to incorporate 
digital competencies in the undergraduate medical curriculum.

Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States.

BACKGROUND: Clinicians often disregard potentially beneficial clinical decision
support (CDS).
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the psychological and behavioral
barriers to the use of a CDS tool.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study involving emergency medicine physicians
and physician assistants. A semistructured interview guide was created based on
the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation-Behavior model. Interviews focused on
the barriers to the use of a CDS tool built based on Wells' criteria for
pulmonary embolism to assist clinicians in establishing pretest probability of
pulmonary embolism before imaging.
RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 12 clinicians. Six barriers were
identified, including (1) Bayesian reasoning, (2) fear of missing a pulmonary
embolism, (3) time pressure or cognitive load, (4) gestalt includes Wells'
criteria, (5) missed risk factors, and (6) social pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians highlighted several important psychological and
behavioral barriers to CDS use. Addressing these barriers will be paramount in
developing CDS that can meet its potential to transform clinical care.

KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa.

Background: Warts can be extremely painful conditions that may be associated with
localised bleeding and discharge. They are commonly treated by cryotherapy or
immunotherapy. However, each of these therapies have discomforting side effects
and are no official dermatological guideline that exist that may be used to
determine which of these methods would work on an individual patient.
Objective: This study aimed at developing a machine learning algorithm that
improved the prediction of the outcome of wart removing using cryotherapy and
immunotherapy.
Methods: Support vector machines, core vector machines, random forest, k-nearest 
neighbours, multilayer perceptron and binary logistic regression was applied on
datasets in to create a model that predicted the outcome of an immunotherapy and 
cryotherapy treatments based on sex, age, time that has passed since last
treatment, number of warts, type, area, diameter and result of treatment.
Results: The average accuracy of the immunotherapy prediction was 88.6%±8.0%
while the same measure for cryotherapy prediction was 94.6%±4.0%. The most
efficient immunotherapy and cryotherapy model had an accuracy of 100%,
predicating the correct treatment outcome when applied to all test cases.
Conclusion: This study successfully created a machine learning model that
improved the prediction ability of the outcome of immunotherapy and cryotherapy
for wart removal. This model created a more in-depth guideline for understanding 
is immunotherapy would work and took a new approach to cryotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Clinical scores are frequently used in the diagnosis and management
of stroke. While medical calculators are increasingly important support tools for
clinical decisions, the uptake and use of common medical calculators for stroke
remain poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe use patterns in frequently used stroke-related
medical calculators for clinical decisions from a web-based support system.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of calculators from MDCalc, a
web-based and mobile app-based medical calculator platform based in the United
States. We analyzed metadata tags from MDCalc's calculator use data to identify
all calculators related to stroke. Using relative page views as a measure of
calculator use, we determined the 5 most frequently used stroke-related
calculators between January 2016 and December 2018. For all 5 calculators, we
determined cumulative and quarterly use, mode of access (eg, app or web browser),
and both US and international distributions of use. We compared cumulative use in
the 2016-2018 period with use from January 2011 to December 2015.
RESULTS: Over the study period, we identified 454 MDCalc calculators, of which 48
(10.6%) were related to stroke. Of these, the 5 most frequently used calculators 
were the CHA2DS2-VASc score for atrial fibrillation stroke risk calculator (5.5% 
of total and 32% of stroke-related page views), the Mean Arterial Pressure
calculator (2.4% of total and 14.0% of stroke-related page views), the HAS-BLED
score for major bleeding risk (1.9% of total and 11.4% of stroke-related page
views), the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score calculator
(1.7% of total and 10.1% of stroke-related page views), and the CHADS2 score for 
atrial fibrillation stroke risk calculator (1.4% of total and 8.1% of
stroke-related page views). Web browser was the most common mode of access,
accounting for 82.7%-91.2% of individual stroke calculator page views. Access
originated most frequently from the most populated regions within the United
States. Internationally, use originated mostly from English-language countries.
The NIHSS score calculator demonstrated the greatest increase in page views
(238.1% increase) between the first and last quarters of the study period.
CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently used stroke calculators were the CHA2DS2-VASc,
Mean Arterial Pressure, HAS-BLED, NIHSS, and CHADS2. These were mainly accessed
by web browser, from English-speaking countries, and from highly populated areas.
Further studies should investigate barriers to stroke calculator adoption and the
effect of calculator use on the application of best practices in cerebrovascular 
disease.

OBJECTIVES: Prior to COVID-19, levels of adoption of telehealth were low in the
U.S., though they exploded during the pandemic. Following the pandemic, it will
be critical to identify the characteristics that were associated with adoption of
telehealth prior to the pandemic as key drivers of adoption and outside of a
public health emergency.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined three data sources: The American Telemedicine 
Association's 2019 state telehealth analysis, the American Hospital Association's
2018 annual survey of acute care hospitals and its Information Technology
Supplement. Telehealth adoption was measured through five telehealth categories. 
Independent variables included seven hospital characteristics and five
reimbursement policies. After bivariate comparisons, we developed a multivariable
model using logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with
telehealth adoption.
RESULTS: Among 2923 US hospitals, 73% had at least one telehealth capability.
More than half of these hospitals invested in telehealth consultation services
and stroke care. Non-profit hospitals, affiliated hospitals, major teaching
hospitals, and hospitals located in micropolitan areas (those with 10-50,000
people) were more likely to adopt telehealth. In contrast, hospitals that lacked 
electronic clinical documentation, were unaffiliated with a hospital system, or
were investor-owned had lower odds of adopting telehealth. None of the statewide 
policies were associated with adoption of telehealth.
CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth policy requires major revisions soon, and we suggest that
these policies should be national rather than at the state level. Further steps
as incentivizing rural hospitals for adopting interoperable systems and expanding
RPM billing opportunities will help drive adoption, and promote equity.

BACKGROUND: In medical diagnosis and clinical practice, diagnosing a disease
early is crucial for accurate treatment, lessening the stress on the healthcare
system. In medical imaging research, image processing techniques tend to be vital
in analyzing and resolving diseases with a high degree of accuracy. This paper
establishes a new image classification and segmentation method through simulation
techniques, conducted over images of COVID-19 patients in India, introducing the 
use of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in medical practice.
METHODS: This study establishes a prototype model for classifying COVID-19,
comparing it with non-COVID pneumonia signals in Computed tomography (CT) images.
The simulation work evaluates the usage of quantum machine learning algorithms,
while assessing the efficacy for deep learning models for image classification
problems, and thereby establishes performance quality that is required for
improved prediction rate when dealing with complex clinical image data exhibiting
high biases.
RESULTS: The study considers a novel algorithmic implementation leveraging
quantum neural network (QNN). The proposed model outperformed the conventional
deep learning models for specific classification task. The performance was
evident because of the efficiency of quantum simulation and faster convergence
property solving for an optimization problem for network training particularly
for large-scale biased image classification task. The model run-time observed on 
quantum optimized hardware was 52 min, while on K80 GPU hardware it was 1 h
30 min for similar sample size. The simulation shows that QNN outperforms DNN,
CNN, 2D CNN by more than 2.92% in gain in accuracy measure with an average recall
of around 97.7%.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that quantum neural networks outperform in
COVID-19 traits' classification task, comparing to deep learning w.r.t model
efficacy and training time. However, a further study needs to be conducted to
evaluate implementation scenarios by integrating the model within medical
devices.

There is much discussion concerning 'digital transformation' in healthcare and
the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare systems. Yet it
remains rare to find AI solutions deployed in routine healthcare settings. This
is in part due to the numerous challenges inherent in delivering an AI project in
a clinical environment. In this article, several UK healthcare professionals and 
academics reflect on the challenges they have faced in building AI solutions
using routinely collected healthcare data.These personal reflections are
summarised as 10 practical tips. In our experience, these are essential
considerations for an AI healthcare project to succeed. They are organised into
four phases: conceptualisation, data management, AI application and clinical
deployment. There is a focus on conceptualisation, reflecting our view that
initial set-up is vital to success. We hope that our personal experiences will
provide useful insights to others looking to improve patient care through optimal
data use.

BACKGROUND: Due to an aging population, the demand for many services is exceeding
the capacity of the clinical workforce. As a result, staff are facing a crisis of
burnout from being pressured to deliver high-volume workloads, driving increasing
costs for providers. Artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of conversational 
agents, presents a possible opportunity to enable efficiency in the delivery of
care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, usability, and
acceptability of Dora agent: Ufonia's autonomous voice conversational agent, an
AI-enabled autonomous telemedicine call for the detection of postoperative
cataract surgery patients who require further assessment. The objectives of this 
study are to establish Dora's efficacy in comparison with an expert clinician,
determine baseline sensitivity and specificity for the detection of true
complications, evaluate patient acceptability, collect evidence for
cost-effectiveness, and capture data to support further development and
evaluation.
METHODS: Using an implementation science construct, the interdisciplinary study
will be a mixed methods phase 1 pilot establishing interobserver reliability of
the system, usability, and acceptability. This will be done using the following
scales and frameworks: the system usability scale; assessment of Health
Information Technology Interventions in Evidence-Based Medicine Evaluation
Framework; the telehealth usability questionnaire; and the Non-Adoption,
Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability framework.
RESULTS: The evaluation is expected to show that conversational technology can be
used to conduct an accurate assessment and that it is acceptable to different
populations with different backgrounds. In addition, the results will demonstrate
how successfully the system can be delivered in organizations with different
clinical pathways and how it can be integrated with their existing platforms.
CONCLUSIONS: The project's key contributions will be evidence of the
effectiveness of AI voice conversational agents and their associated usability
and acceptability.

With advancements in computer systems, computer graphics and medical imaging
technologies, clinicians strive for a personalised approach to patient treatment.
Therefore, the production of personalised surgical guides is becoming standard.
While proprietary software solutions for mandibular reconstruction planning
exist, they are often not available due to their high costs. There are multiple
alternative methods available, which utilise open-source technologies and free
software, but they use advanced three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided design
(CAD) concepts. The goal of this article is to provide end-users (surgeons,
radiologists, or radiology technicians) with a tool that offers an intuitive
interface and a simple workflow. The tool provides only the necessary methods
offering a high degree of automation and abstracting the underlying 3D CAD
concepts. This is accomplished by providing an add-on (written in Python) for a
free and open-source software package Blender.

BACKGROUND: Hospitals across Australia are implementing Clinical Information
Systems, e.g. Electronic Medication Management Systems (EMMS) at a rapid pace to 
moderate health services. The benefits of the EMMS depend on the acceptance of
the system by the clinicians. The study hospital used a unique patient-centric
implementation strategy that was based on the guiding principle of "one patient, 
one chart" to avoid a patient being on a hybrid medication chart. This paper aims
to study the factors facilitating or hindering the adoption of the EMMS as viewed
by clinicians and the implementation team.
METHODS: Four focus groups (FG), one each for (1) doctors, (2) nurses, (3)
pharmacists, and (4) implementation team, were conducted. A guide for the FG was 
based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).
RESULTS: A total of 23 unique subthemes were identified and were grouped into
five main themes (1) implementation strategy, (2) organisational outcome of EMMS,
(3) individual impact of EMMS, (4) IT product, and (5) organisational culture.
Clinicians reported improvement in their workflow efficiency post-EMMS
implementation. They also reported some challenges in using the EMMS that
centered around the area of infrastructure, technical and design issues.
Additionally, the implementation team highlighted two crucial factors influencing
the success of EMMS implementation, namely: (1) the patient-centric
implementation strategy, and (2) the organisation readiness.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study outlines the implementation process of the EMMS
in a large healthcare facility from the clinicians' and the implementation team's
perspectives using UTAUT model. The result suggests that clinicians' acceptance
of the EMMS was highly influenced by the unique implementation strategy (namely, 
patient-centric approach and clinical leadership in the implementation team).
Whereas the level of adoption of EMMS by clinicians was determined by their level
of perceived and realised benefits. On the other hand, a number of barriers to
the adoption of EMMS were discovered, namely, general training instead of
customised training based on local needs, technical and design issues and lack of
availability of computer systems. It is suggested that promptly resolving these
issues can improve the adoption of the EMMS.

CONTEXT: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a leading cause of hypercalcemia and
secondary osteoporosis, is underdiagnosed.
OBJECTIVE: This work aims to establish a foundation for an electronic medical
record-based intervention that would prompt serum parathyroid hormone (PTH)
assessment in patients with persistent hypercalcemia and identify care gaps in
their management.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary academic health
system of outpatients with persistent hypercalcemia, who were categorized as
having classic or normohormonal PHPT. Main outcome measures included the
frequencies of serum PTH measurement in patients with persistent hypercalcemia,
and their subsequent workup with bone mineral density (BMD) assessment, and
ultimately, medical therapy or parathyroidectomy.
RESULTS: Among 3151 patients with persistent hypercalcemia, 1526 (48%) had PTH
measured, of whom 1377 (90%) were confirmed to have classic (49%) or
normohormonal (41%) PHPT. PTH was measured in 65% of hypercalcemic patients with 
osteopenia or osteoporosis (P < .001). At median 2-year follow-up, bone density
was assessed in 275 (20%) patients with either variant of PHPT (P = .003). Of
women aged 50 years or older with classic PHPT, 95 (19%) underwent BMD
assessment. Of patients with classic or normohormonal PHPT, 919 patients (67%)
met consensus criteria for surgical intervention, though only 143 (15%) underwent
parathyroidectomy.
CONCLUSION: Within a large academic health system, more than half of patients
with confirmed hypercalcemia were not assessed for PHPT, including many patients 
with preexisting bone disease. Care gaps in BMD assessment and medical or
surgical therapy represent missed opportunities to avoid skeletal and other
complications of PHPT.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak required prompt action by health authorities
around the world in response to a novel threat. With enormous amounts of
information originating in sources with uncertain degree of validation and
accuracy, it is essential to provide executive-level decision-makers with the
most actionable, pertinent, and updated data analysis to enable them to adapt
their strategy swiftly and competently.
OBJECTIVE: We report here the origination of a COVID-19 dedicated response in the
Israel Defense Forces with the assembly of an operational Data Center for the
Campaign against Coronavirus.
METHODS: Spearheaded by directors with clinical, operational, and data analytics 
orientation, a multidisciplinary team utilized existing and newly developed
platforms to collect and analyze large amounts of information on an individual
level in the context of SARS-CoV-2 contraction and infection.
RESULTS: Nearly 300,000 responses to daily questionnaires were recorded and were 
merged with other data sets to form a unified data lake. By using basic as well
as advanced analytic tools ranging from simple aggregation and display of trends 
to data science application, we provided commanders and clinicians with access to
trusted, accurate, and personalized information and tools that were designed to
foster operational changes and mitigate the propagation of the pandemic. The
developed tools aided in the in the identification of high-risk individuals for
severe disease and resulted in a 30% decline in their attendance to their units. 
Moreover, the queue for laboratory examination for COVID-19 was optimized using a
predictive model and resulted in a high true-positive rate of 20%, which is more 
than twice as high as the baseline rate (2.28%, 95% CI 1.63%-3.19%).
CONCLUSIONS: In times of ambiguity and uncertainty, along with an unprecedented
flux of information, health organizations may find multidisciplinary teams
working to provide intelligence from diverse and rich data a key factor in
providing executives relevant and actionable support for decision-making.

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has also emerged as an infodemic,
thereby worsening the harm of the pandemic. This situation has highlighted the
need for a deeply rooted understanding of the health information-seeking
behaviors (HISBs) of people.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to review and provide insight regarding
methodologies and the construct of content in HISB surveys by answering the
following research question: what are the characteristics of the measurement
tools for assessing HISBs in nationally representative surveys around the world?
METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
was used as the framework for this study. A data search was performed through 5
international and 2 Korean databases covering the years between 2008 and 2020.
Initially, studies performed among nationally representative samples were
included to discover HISB survey instruments. The methodologies of the studies
using HISB surveys were analyzed. For content analysis, 2 researchers reached a
consensus through discussion by scrutinizing the contents of each survey
questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 13 survey tools from 8 countries were identified after a
review of 2333 records from the search results. Five survey tools (Health
Information National Trends Survey, Health Tracking Survey, Annenberg National
Health Communication Survey, National Health Interview Survey, and Health
Tracking Household Survey) from the United States, 2 instruments from Germany,
and 1 tool from each of the countries of the European Union, France, Israel,
Poland, South Korea, and Taiwan were identified. Telephone or web-based surveys
were commonly used targeting the adult population (≥15 years of age). From the
content analysis, the domains of the survey items were categorized as follows:
information (information about health and patient medical records), channel
(offline and online), and health (overall health, lifestyle, and cancer). All
categories encompassed behavioral and attitude dimensions. A theoretical
framework, that is, an information-channel-health structure for HISBs was
proposed.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study can contribute to the development and
implementation of the survey tools for HISB with integrated questionnaire items. 
This will help in understanding HISB trends in national health care.

Objectives: From the view of everyday practices and the socio-technical
coordination lens, this study aimed to analyz the gap between creators' intention
and the users' implementation (mainly nursing staff and social workers) of an
alert system in assisted living communities.
Methods: Qualitative methods were employed by way of five user interviews and
focus groups with six system developers. Modeling instruments were applied for
data collection to analyze the different clinical workflows versus the
expectations of the system development team.
Results: Results indicate that the clinical workflow changed over time, which led
to a mismatch of nurse care coordination, social practices, and technology use.
The results show different mental models of the socio-technical practice.
Applying the coordination theory, the following recommendations could be
developed to overcome the mismatch. First, it is recommended that nursing staff
set goals together. Second, a communication rhythm with the nursing staff and
developer teams should be established, with guided questions to facilitate the
conversation, to shed light on the different workflows and the difference in
social practices when using sensor technologies or alert systems. Third, a
checklist for new employees should be created so they know how and on which
devices to use the alert system. Fourth, the user experience with the alert
system should be improved (e.g., an improved user interface).
Conclusions: This work indicates recommendations to close the mental model gap to
overcome the mismatch between optimal use of the alert system and how the nursing
staff is actually using it.

OBJECTIVES: Patients with COVID-19 can present to the emergency department (ED)
without immediate indication for admission, but with concern for decompensation. 
Clinical experience has demonstrated that critical illness may present later in
the disease course and hypoxia is often the first indication of disease
progression. The objectives of this study are to (a) assess feasibility and
describe a protocol for ED-based outpatient pulse-oximetry monitoring with
structured follow-up and (b) determine rates of ED return, hospitalisation and
hypoxia among participants.
METHODS: Prospective observational study of patients presenting to a single
academic ED in Boston with suspected COVID-19. Eligible patients were adults
being discharged from the ED with presumed COVID-19. Exclusion criteria included 
resting oxygen saturation <92%, ambulatory oxygen saturation <90%, heart rate
>110 beats per minute or inability to use the device. Study personnel made
scripted phone calls on postdischarge days 1, 3 and 7 to review the
pulse-oximetry readings and to evaluate for decompensation. Return visit and
admission information were collected via medical record and 28-day follow-up
calls.
RESULTS: 81 patients were enrolled of which 10 (12%) developed hypoxia after
their initial discharge from the ED. Overall, 23 (28%) of the 81 patients
returned to the ED at least once and 10 of those who returned (43%) were
admitted. We successfully contacted 76/81 (94%) of subjects via phone at least
once for follow-up assessment.
DISCUSSION: Patients are eager and willing to participate in home monitoring
systems and are comfortable with using technology, which will allow providers and
health systems to extend our hospitals capabilities for tracking patient
populations in times of crisis.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to implement an outpatient pulse-oximetry monitoring 
protocol to monitor patients discharged from the ED with confirmed or suspected
COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: To meet the growing importance of real-word data analysis, clinical
data and biosamples must be timely made available. Feasibility platforms are
often the first contact point for determining the availability of such data for
specific research questions. Therefore, a user-friendly interface should be
provided to enable access to this information easily. The German Medical
Informatics Initiative also aims to establish such a platform for its
infrastructure. Although some of these platforms are actively used, their tools
still have limitations. Consequently, the Medical Informatics Initiative
consortium MIRACUM (Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University
Medicine) committed itself to analyzing the pros and cons of existing solutions
and to designing an optimized graphical feasibility user interface.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the system that is most
user-friendly and thus forms the best basis for developing a harmonized tool. To 
achieve this goal, we carried out a comparative usability evaluation of existing 
tools used by researchers acting as end users.
METHODS: The evaluation included three preselected search tools and was conducted
as a qualitative exploratory study with a randomized design over a period of 6
weeks. The tools in question were the MIRACUM i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating
Biology and the Bedside) feasibility platform, OHDSI's (Observational Health Data
Sciences and Informatics) ATLAS, and the Sample Locator of the German Biobank
Alliance. The evaluation was conducted in the form of a web-based usability test 
(usability walkthrough combined with a web-based questionnaire) with participants
aged between 26 and 63 years who work as medical doctors.
RESULTS: In total, 17 study participants evaluated the three tools. The overall
evaluation of usability, which was based on the System Usability Scale, showed
that the Sample Locator, with a mean System Usability Scale score of 77.03 (SD
20.62), was significantly superior to the other two tools (Wilcoxon test; Sample 
Locator vs i2b2: P=.047; Sample Locator vs ATLAS: P=.001). i2b2, with a score of 
59.83 (SD 25.36), performed significantly better than ATLAS, which had a score of
27.81 (SD 21.79; Wilcoxon test; i2b2 vs ATLAS: P=.005). The analysis of the
material generated by the usability walkthrough method confirmed these findings. 
ATLAS caused the most usability problems (n=66), followed by i2b2 (n=48) and the 
Sample Locator (n=22). Moreover, the Sample Locator achieved the highest ratings 
with respect to additional questions regarding satisfaction with the tools.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides data to develop a suitable basis for the
selection of a harmonized tool for feasibility studies via concrete evaluation
and a comparison of the usability of three different types of query builders. The
feedback obtained from the participants during the usability test made it
possible to identify user problems and positive design aspects of the individual 
tools and compare them qualitatively.

BACKGROUND: Medical schools worldwide are accelerating the introduction of
digital health courses into their curricula. The COVID-19 pandemic has
contributed to this swift and widespread transition to digital health and
education. However, the need for digital health competencies goes beyond the
COVID-19 pandemic because they are becoming essential for the delivery of
effective, efficient, and safe care.
OBJECTIVE: This review aims to collate and analyze studies evaluating digital
health education for medical students to inform the development of future courses
and identify areas where curricula may need to be strengthened.
METHODS: We carried out a scoping review by following the guidance of the Joanna 
Briggs Institute, and the results were reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for
Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We searched 6 major bibliographic databases and gray
literature sources for articles published between January 2000 and November 2019.
Two authors independently screened the retrieved citations and extracted the data
from the included studies. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus discussions
between the authors. The findings were analyzed using thematic analysis and
presented narratively.
RESULTS: A total of 34 studies focusing on different digital courses were
included in this review. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) were published between 
2010 and 2019 and originated in the United States (20/34, 59%). The reported
digital health courses were mostly elective (20/34, 59%), were integrated into
the existing curriculum (24/34, 71%), and focused mainly on medical informatics
(17/34, 50%). Most of the courses targeted medical students from the first to
third year (17/34, 50%), and the duration of the courses ranged from 1 hour to 3 
academic years. Most of the studies (22/34, 65%) reported the use of blended
education. A few of the studies (6/34, 18%) delivered courses entirely digitally 
by using online modules, offline learning, massive open online courses, and
virtual patient simulations. The reported courses used various assessment
approaches such as paper-based assessments, in-person observations, and online
assessments. Most of the studies (30/34, 88%) evaluated courses mostly by using
an uncontrolled before-and-after design and generally reported improvements in
students' learning outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital health courses reported in literature are mostly elective,
focus on a single area of digital health, and lack robust evaluation. They have
diverse delivery, development, and assessment approaches. There is an urgent need
for high-quality studies that evaluate digital health education.

Objective: Understanding health informatics (HI) publication trends in Saudi
Arabia may serve as a framework for future research efforts and contribute toward
meeting national "e-Health" goals. The authors' intention was to understand the
state of the HI field in Saudi Arabia by exploring publication trends and their
alignment with national goals.
Methods: A scoping review was performed to identify HI publications from Saudi
Arabia in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. We analyzed publication trends
based on topics, keywords, and how they align with the Ministry of Health's
(MOH's) "digital health journey" framework.
Results: The total number of publications included was 242. We found 1 (0.4%)
publication in 1995-1999, 11 (4.5%) publications in 2000-2009, and 230 (95.0%)
publications in 2010-2019. We categorized publications into 3 main HI fields and 
4 subfields: 73.1% (n=177) of publications were in clinical informatics (85.1%,
n=151 medical informatics; 5.6%, n=10 pharmacy informatics; 6.8%, n=12 nursing
informatics; 2.3%, n=4 dental informatics); 22.3% (n=54) were in consumer health 
informatics; and 4.5% (n=11) were in public health informatics. The most common
keyword was "medical informatics" (21.5%, n=52). MOH framework-based analysis
showed that most publications were categorized as "digitally enabled care" and
"digital health foundations."
Conclusions: The years of 2000-2009 may be seen as an infancy stage of the HI
field in Saudi Arabia. Exploring how the Saudi Arabian MOH's e-Health initiatives
may influence research is valuable for advancing the field. Data exchange and
interoperability, artificial intelligence, and intelligent health enterprises
might be future research directions in Saudi Arabia.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare pharmacy students' ability to
correctly answer drug information questions using Micromedex with Watson,
Micromedex without Watson, or Google.
Methods: This multicenter randomized trial compared pharmacy student responses to
drug information questions using Micromedex with Watson, Micromedex without
Watson, or Google from January to March of 2020. First- to fourth-year pharmacy
students at two institutions were included. The primary outcome was the number of
correct answers. Secondary outcomes were the time taken to answer the questions
and differences in number of correct answers by pharmacy student year and
institution.
Results: The analysis included 162 participants: 52 students in the Micromedex
group, 51 students in the Watson group, and 59 students in the Google group.
There was a significant difference among groups in the total number of questions 
answered correctly (p=0.02). Post-hoc analysis revealed that participants in the 
Micromedex group answered more questions correctly than those in the Google group
(p=0.015). There were no significant differences between Micromedex and Watson
groups (p=0.52) or between Watson and Google groups (p=0.22). There was also no
difference in time to complete the questions among groups (p=0.72).
Conclusion: Utilizing Google did not save students time and led to more incorrect
answers. These findings suggest that health care educators and health sciences
librarians should further reinforce training on the appropriate use of drug
information resources.

OBJECTIVES: As yet, there is no European data standard for naming and describing 
oncology regimens. To enable real-world cancer treatment data comparisons, the
Oncology Data Network created a unified reference database for systemic
anti-cancer regimens used in practice across Europe. Data are extracted from
clinical systems and mapped to a single standard called the "Core Regimen
Reference Library (CRRL)". An automated matching algorithm has been designed
based on: drug combinations; administration schedule; and dosing and route of
administration. Incomplete matches are flagged for expert review. The aim of this
pilot study is to have an expert pharmacist panel test the algorithm's
feasibility by comparing computerised and manual matching of regimens that are
currently in use in different European countries.
METHODS: The combined team pooled a diverse sample of 47 reference regimens used 
in Europe for solid and haematological cancers. These were then codified to the
developed common data standard and the algorithm was used to match them to the
CRRL. The expert pharmacist panel from the European Society of Oncology Pharmacy 
(ESOP) selected 12 regimens from the sample set, ranging from simple to complex, 
and performed a single-blind test of the algorithm, by systematically matching
each original regimen to the CRRL.
RESULTS: ESOP validated the algorithm's feasibility based on full concurrence
between manual and computer matches thereby validating the algorithm rules and
logic with regard to what defines the core characteristics of a regimen and how
to compare similarities and differences.
CONCLUSIONS: ESOP's validation of the matching algorithm and approach to curating
a master library provides confidence in their utility for reliable comparison of 
real-world regimen usage across Europe.

BACKGROUND: Public web-based COVID-19 dashboards are in use worldwide to
communicate pandemic-related information. Actionability of dashboards, as a
predictor of their potential use for data-driven decision-making, was assessed in
a global study during the early stages of the pandemic. It revealed a widespread 
lack of features needed to support actionability. In view of the inherently
dynamic nature of dashboards and their unprecedented speed of creation, the
evolution of dashboards and changes to their actionability merit exploration.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore how COVID-19 dashboards evolved in the Canadian
context during 2020 and whether the presence of actionability features changed
over time.
METHODS: We conducted a descriptive assessment of a pan-Canadian sample of
COVID-19 dashboards (N=26), followed by an appraisal of changes to their
actionability by a panel of expert scorers (N=8). Scorers assessed the dashboards
at two points in time, July and November 2020, using an assessment tool informed 
by communication theory and health care performance intelligence. Applying the
nominal group technique, scorers were grouped in panels of three, and evaluated
the presence of the seven defined features of highly actionable dashboards at
each time point.
RESULTS: Improvements had been made to the dashboards over time. These
predominantly involved data provision (specificity of geographic breakdowns,
range of indicators reported, and explanations of data sources or calculations)
and advancements enabled by the technologies employed (customization of time
trends and interactive or visual chart elements). Further improvements in
actionability were noted especially in features involving local-level data
provision, time-trend reporting, and indicator management. No improvements were
found in communicative elements (clarity of purpose and audience), while the use 
of storytelling techniques to narrate trends remained largely absent from the
dashboards.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements to COVID-19 dashboards in the Canadian context during
2020 were seen mostly in data availability and dashboard technology. Further
improving the actionability of dashboards for public reporting will require
attention to both technical and organizational aspects of dashboard development. 
Such efforts would include better skill-mixing across disciplines, continued
investment in data standards, and clearer mandates for their developers to ensure
accountability and the development of purpose-driven dashboards.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to determine whether machine learning can predict
initial inpatient total daily dose (TDD) of insulin from electronic health
records more accurately than existing guideline-based dosing recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using electronic health records from a tertiary academic
center between 2008 and 2020 of 16,848 inpatients receiving subcutaneous insulin 
who achieved target blood glucose control of 100-180 mg/dL on a calendar day, we 
trained an ensemble machine learning algorithm consisting of regularized
regression, random forest, and gradient boosted tree models for 2-stage TDD
prediction. We evaluated the ability to predict patients requiring more than 6
units TDD and their point-value TDDs to achieve target glucose control.
RESULTS: The method achieves an area under the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.87) and area under the
precision-recall curve of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.64-0.67) for classifying patients who
require more than 6 units TDD. For patients requiring more than 6 units TDD, the 
mean absolute percent error in dose prediction based on standard clinical
calculators using patient weight is in the range of 136%-329%, while the
regression model based on weight improves to 60% (95% CI, 57%-63%), and the full 
ensemble model further improves to 51% (95% CI, 48%-54%).
DISCUSSION: Owingto the narrow therapeutic window and wide individual
variability, insulin dosing requires adaptive and predictive approaches that can 
be supported through data-driven analytic tools.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning approaches based on readily available electronic
medical records can discriminate which inpatients will require more than 6 units 
TDD and estimate individual doses more accurately than standard guidelines and
practices.

OBJECTIVES: Until this point there was no national core competency framework for 
clinical informatics in the UK. We report on the final two iterations of work
carried out in the formation of a national core competency framework. This
follows an initial systematic literature review of existing skills and
competencies and a job listing analysis.MethodsAn iterative approach was applied 
to framework development. Using a mixed-methods design we carried out
semi-structured interviews with participants involved in informatics (n=15). The 
framework was updated based on the interview findings and was subsequently
distributed as part of a bespoke online digital survey for wider participation
(n=87). The final version of the framework is based on the findings of the
survey.
RESULTS: Over 102 people reviewed the framework as part of the interview or
survey process. This led to a final core competency framework containing 6
primary domains with 36 subdomains containing 111 individual competencies.
CONCLUSIONS: An iterative mixed-methods approach for competency development
involving the target community was appropriate for development of the competency 
framework. There is some contention around the depth of technical competencies
required. Care is also needed to avoid professional burnout, as clinicians and
healthcare practitioners already have clinical competencies to maintain.
Therefore, how the framework is applied in practice and how practitioners meet
the competencies requires careful consideration.

BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2,
causing COVID-19, as a pandemic. The UK mass vaccination program commenced on
December 8, 2020, vaccinating groups of the population deemed to be most
vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the early vaccine administration coverage
and outcome data across an integrated care system in North West London,
leveraging a unique population-level care data set. Vaccine effectiveness of a
single dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines were compared.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study identified 2,183,939 individuals eligible
for COVID-19 vaccination between December 8, 2020, and February 24, 2021, within 
a primary, secondary, and community care integrated care data set. These data
were used to assess vaccination hesitancy across ethnicity, gender, and
socioeconomic deprivation measures (Pearson product-moment correlations);
investigate COVID-19 transmission related to vaccination hubs; and assess the
early effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination (after a single dose) using
time-to-event analyses with multivariable Cox regression analysis to investigate 
if vaccination independently predicted positive SARS-CoV-2 in those vaccinated
compared to those unvaccinated.
RESULTS: In this study, 5.88% (24,332/413,919) of individuals declined and did
not receive a vaccination. Black or Black British individuals had the highest
rate of declining a vaccine at 16.14% (4337/26,870). There was a strong negative 
association between socioeconomic deprivation and rate of declining vaccination
(r=-0.94; P=.002) with 13.5% (1980/14,571) of individuals declining vaccination
in the most deprived areas compared to 0.98% (869/9609) in the least. In the
first 6 days after vaccination, 344 of 389,587 (0.09%) individuals tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate increased to 0.13% (525/389,243) between days 7
and 13, before then gradually falling week on week. At 28 days post vaccination, 
there was a 74% (hazard ratio 0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.35) and 78% (hazard ratio 0.22,
95% CI 0.18-0.27) reduction in risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for
individuals that received the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines,
respectively, when compared with unvaccinated individuals. A very low proportion 
of hospital admissions were seen in vaccinated individuals who tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 (288/389,587, 0.07% of all patients vaccinated) providing evidence
for vaccination effectiveness after a single dose.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no definitive evidence to suggest COVID-19 was transmitted
as a result of vaccination hubs during the vaccine administration rollout in
North West London, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 or becoming hospitalized 
after vaccination has been demonstrated to be low in the vaccinated population.
This study provides further evidence that a single dose of either the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is effective at
reducing the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 up to 60 days across all age
groups, ethnic groups, and risk categories in an urban UK population.

BACKGROUND: Participation in quality controls, also called external quality
assessment (EQA) schemes, is required for the ISO15189 accreditation of the
Medical Centers of Human Genetics. However, directives on the minimal frequency
of participation in genetic quality control schemes are lacking or too
heterogeneous, with a possible impact on health care quality.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project is to develop Belgian guidelines on the
frequency of participation in quality controls for genetic testing in the context
of rare diseases.
METHODS: A group of experts analyzed 90 EQA schemes offered by accredited
providers and focused on analyses used for the diagnosis of rare diseases. On
that basis, the experts developed practical recommendations about the minimal
frequencies of participation of the Medical Centers of Human Genetics in quality 
controls and how to deal with poor performances and change management. These
guidelines were submitted to the Belgian Accreditation Body and then reviewed and
approved by the Belgian College of Human Genetics and Rare Diseases and by the
National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance.
RESULTS: The guidelines offer a decisional algorithm for the minimal frequency of
participation in human genetics EQA schemes. This algorithm has been developed
taking into account the scopes of the EQA schemes, the levels of experience, and 
the annual volumes of the Centers of Human Genetics in the performance of the
tests considered. They include three key principles: (1) the recommended annual
assessment of all genetic techniques and technological platforms, if possible
through EQAs covering the technique, genotyping, and clinical interpretation; (2)
the triennial assessment of the genotyping and interpretation of specific
germline mutations and pharmacogenomics analyses; and (3) the documentation of
actions undertaken in the case of poor performances and the participation to
quality control the following year. The use of a Bayesian statistical model has
been proposed to help the Centers of Human Genetics to determine the theoretical 
number of tests that should be annually performed to achieve a certain threshold 
of performance (eg, a maximal error rate of 1%). Besides, the guidelines insist
on the role and responsibility of the national public health authorities in the
follow-up of the quality of analyses performed by the Medical Centers of Human
Genetics and in demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and rationalization of
participation frequency in these quality controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These guidelines have been developed based on the analysis of a
large panel of EQA schemes and data collected from the Belgian Medical Centers of
Human Genetics. They are applicable to other countries and will facilitate and
improve the quality management and financing systems of the Medical Centers of
Human Genetics.

Measuring the Interactions Between Health Demand, Informatics Supply, and
Technological Applications in Digital Medical Innovation for China: Content
Mapping and Analysis.

BACKGROUND: There were 2 major incentives introduced by the Chinese government to
promote medical informatics in 2009 and 2016. As new drugs are the major source
of medical innovation, informatics-related concepts and techniques are a major
source of digital medical innovation. However, it is unclear whether the research
efforts of medical informatics in China have met the health needs, such as
disease management and population health.
OBJECTIVE: We proposed an approach to mapping the interplay between different
knowledge entities by using the tree structure of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
to gain insights into the interactions between informatics supply, health demand,
and technological applications in digital medical innovation in China.
METHODS: All terms under the MeSH tree parent node "Diseases [C]" or node "Health
[N01.400]" or "Public Health [N06.850]" were labelled as H. All terms under the
node "Information Science [L]" were labelled as I, and all terms under node
"Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques, and Equipment [E]" were
labelled as T. The H-I-T interactions can be measured by using their
co-occurrences in a given publication.
RESULTS: The H-I-T interactions in China are showing significant growth and a
more concentrated interplay were observed. Computing methodologies, informatics, 
and communications media (such as social media and the internet) constitute the
majority of I-related concepts and techniques used for resolving the health
promotion and diseases management problems in China. Generally there is a
positive correlation between the burden and informatics research efforts for
diseases in China. We think it is not contradictory that informatics research
should be focused on the greatest burden of diseases or where it can have the
most impact. Artificial intelligence is a competing field of medical informatics 
research in China, with a notable focus on diagnostic deep learning algorithms
for medical imaging.
CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that technological transfers, namely the
functionality to be realized by medical/health informatics (eg, diagnosis,
therapeutics, surgical procedures, laboratory testing techniques, and equipment
and supplies) should be strengthened. Research on natural language processing and
electronic health records should also be strengthened to improve the real-world
applications of health information technologies and big data in the future.

BACKGROUND: New technology adoption is common in health care, but it may elicit
frustration if end users are not sufficiently considered in their design or
trained in their use. These frustrations may contribute to burnout.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate and quantify health care workers'
frustration with technology and its relationship with emotional exhaustion, after
controlling for measures of work-life integration that may indicate excessive job
demands.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational study of health care workers
across 31 Michigan hospitals. We used the Safety, Communication, Operational
Reliability, and Engagement (SCORE) survey to measure work-life integration and
emotional exhaustion among the survey respondents. We used mixed-effects
hierarchical linear regression to evaluate the relationship among frustration
with technology, other components of work-life integration, and emotional
exhaustion, with adjustment for unit and health care worker characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 15,505 respondents, 5065 (32.7%) reported that they experienced
frustration with technology on at least 3-5 days per week. Frustration with
technology was associated with higher scores for the composite Emotional
Exhaustion scale (r=0.35, P<.001) and each individual item on the Emotional
Exhaustion scale (r=0.29-0.36, P<.001 for all). Each 10-point increase in the
frustration with technology score was associated with a 1.2-point increase (95%
CI 1.1-1.4) in emotional exhaustion (both measured on 100-point scales), after
adjustment for other work-life integration items and unit and health care worker 
characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: This study found that frustration with technology and several other 
markers of work-life integration are independently associated with emotional
exhaustion among health care workers. Frustration with technology is common but
not ubiquitous among health care workers, and it is one of several work-life
integration factors associated with emotional exhaustion. Minimizing frustration 
with health care technology may be an effective approach in reducing burnout
among health care workers.

BACKGROUND: It is assumed that the implementation of health information
technology introduces new vulnerabilities within a complex sociotechnical health 
care system, but no international consensus exists on a standardized format for
enhancing the collection, analysis, and interpretation of technology-induced
errors.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a classification for patient safety
incident reporting associated with the use of mature electronic health records
(EHRs). It also aims to validate the classification by using a data set of
incidents during a 6-month period immediately after the implementation of a new
EHR system.
METHODS: The starting point of the classification development was the Finnish
Technology-Induced Error Risk Assessment Scale tool, based on research on
commonly recognized error types. A multiprofessional research team used iterative
tests on consensus building to develop a classification system. The final
classification, with preliminary descriptions of classes, was validated by
applying it to analyze EHR-related error incidents (n=428) during the
implementation phase of a new EHR system and also to evaluate this
classification's characteristics and applicability for reporting incidents.
Interrater agreement was applied.
RESULTS: The number of EHR-related patient safety incidents during the
implementation period (n=501) was five-fold when compared with the
preimplementation period (n=82). The literature identified new error types that
were added to the emerging classification. Error types were adapted iteratively
after several test rounds to develop a classification for reporting patient
safety incidents in the clinical use of a high-maturity EHR system. Of the 427
classified patient safety incidents, interface problems accounted for 96 (22.5%) 
incident reports, usability problems for 73 (17.1%), documentation problems for
60 (14.1%), and clinical workflow problems for 33 (7.7%). Altogether, 20.8%
(89/427) of reports were related to medication section problems, and downtime
problems were rare (n=8). During the classification work, 14.8% (74/501) of
reports of the original sample were rejected because of insufficient information,
even though the reports were deemed to be related to EHRs. The interrater
agreement during the blinded review was 97.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a new classification for EHR-related patient
safety incidents applicable to mature EHRs. The number of EHR-related patient
safety incidents during the implementation period may reflect patient safety
challenges during the implementation of a new type of high-maturity EHR system.
The results indicate that the types of errors previously identified in the
literature change with the EHR development cycle.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to identify studies combining
the concepts of eHealth and work participation for sick-listed employees across
diagnostic groups in health care and workplace contexts.
INTRODUCTION: There is an increased demand for better health care services and
technologies, and eHealth is proposed as a useful tool to improve efficiency and 
reduce costs. eHealth functions at the intersection of medical informatics,
public health, and business, and may be a promising solution for managing the
process of return to work among employees on sick leave. Assessment of work
outcomes is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of health services, and
there is a need to map the research literature on existing eHealth interventions 
to facilitate work participation.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review considered studies combining two core
concepts: eHealth and work participation. It considered studies on eHealth
interventions for employees (18 to 65 years of age) on sick leave due to any type
of diagnosis or disability, conducted by any stakeholder in workplace or health
care contexts and in any country. Empirical data from both quantitative and
qualitative studies were included.
METHODS: Published and unpublished studies from January 1, 2008, to August 21,
2020, written in English were included in this review. The search was conducted
in MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO clinical registry, and
ClinicalTrials.gov. A three-step search strategy was followed. Data extraction
was performed by two independent reviewers and undertaken using an extraction
tool developed specifically for the scoping review objectives.
RESULTS: This review identified 15 studies eligible for inclusion. Four studies
delivered the eHealth intervention by telephone, while 10 interventions were
web-based. Of the web-based interventions, five had a blended approach, such as
website and email support, or website and social media platforms. One study used 
an app-based intervention. Only eight studies targeted employees sick-listed due 
to common sick leave diagnoses, such as common mental disorders and
musculoskeletal disorders. The workplace context was the target of the eHealth
intervention in seven studies, although the intervention was still delivered by
health personnel such as therapists or occupational physicians. Collaboration on 
individual cases between the health professional, employer, and employee to
facilitate work participation seemed to be rare. Four studies reported both a
theoretical and an empirical base for the intervention used.
CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrated that the use of eHealth interventions to
facilitate work participation is limited, and there is a need for future studies 
on the use of eHealth technology for this purpose. Developing eHealth
interventions specifically for populations at risk of long-term sick leave, and
encouraging collaboration between all relevant stakeholders, may help improve
work participation.

The global rise of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic resulted in an
exponentially increasing demand for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 testing, which resulted in shortage of reagents worldwide. This shortage has
been further worsened by screening of asymptomatic populations such as returning 
employees, students, and so on, as part of plans to reopen the economy. To
optimize the utilization of testing reagents and human resources, pool testing of
populations with low prevalence has emerged as a promising strategy. Although
pooling is an effective solution to reduce the number of reagents used for
testing, the process of pooling samples together and tracking them throughout the
entire workflow is challenging. To be effective, samples must be tracked into
each pool, pool-tested and reported individually. In this article, we address
these challenges using robotics and informatics.

BACKGROUND: Interoperability is a well-known challenge in medical informatics.
Current trends in interoperability have moved from a data model technocentric
approach to sustainable semantics, formal descriptive languages, and processes.
Despite many initiatives and investments for decades, the interoperability
challenge remains crucial. The need for data sharing for most purposes ranging
from patient care to secondary uses, such as public health, research, and quality
assessment, faces unmet problems.
OBJECTIVE: This work was performed in the context of a large Swiss Federal
initiative aiming at building a national infrastructure for reusing consented
data acquired in the health care and research system to enable research in the
field of personalized medicine in Switzerland. The initiative is the Swiss
Personalized Health Network (SPHN). This initiative is providing funding to
foster use and exchange of health-related data for research. As part of the
initiative, a national strategy to enable a semantically interoperable clinical
data landscape was developed and implemented.
METHODS: A deep analysis of various approaches to address interoperability was
performed at the start, including large frameworks in health care, such as Health
Level Seven (HL7) and Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), and in several
domains, such as regulatory agencies (eg, Clinical Data Interchange Standards
Consortium [CDISC]) and research communities (eg, Observational Medical Outcome
Partnership [OMOP]), to identify bottlenecks and assess sustainability. Based on 
this research, a strategy composed of three pillars was designed. It has strong
multidimensional semantics, descriptive formal language for exchanges, and as
many data models as needed to comply with the needs of various communities.
RESULTS: This strategy has been implemented stepwise in Switzerland since the
middle of 2019 and has been adopted by all university hospitals and high research
organizations. The initiative is coordinated by a central organization, the SPHN 
Data Coordination Center of the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The
semantics is mapped by domain experts on various existing standards, such as
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), Logical
Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), and International Classification
of Diseases (ICD). The resource description framework (RDF) is used for storing
and transporting data, and to integrate information from different sources and
standards. Data transformers based on SPARQL query language are implemented to
convert RDF representations to the numerous data models required by the research 
community or bridge with other systems, such as electronic case report forms.
CONCLUSIONS: The SPHN strategy successfully implemented existing standards in a
pragmatic and applicable way. It did not try to build any new standards but used 
existing ones in a nondogmatic way. It has now been funded for another 4 years,
bringing the Swiss landscape into a new dimension to support research in the
field of personalized medicine and large interoperable clinical data.

BACKGROUND: The fact that medical terms require special expertise and are
becoming increasingly complex makes it difficult to employ natural language
processing techniques in medical informatics. Several human-validated reference
standards for medical terms have been developed to evaluate word embedding models
using the semantic similarity and relatedness of medical word pairs. However,
there are very few reference standards in non-English languages. In addition,
because the existing reference standards were developed a long time ago, there is
a need to develop an updated standard to represent recent findings in medical
sciences.
OBJECTIVE: We propose a new Korean word pair reference set to verify embedding
models.
METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2020, 518 medical textbooks, 72,844 health
information news, and 15,698 medical research articles were collected, and the
top 10,000 medical terms were selected to develop medical word pairs. Attending
physicians (n=16) participated in the verification of the developed set with 607 
word pairs.
RESULTS: The proportion of word pairs answered by all participants was 90.8%
(551/607) for the similarity task and 86.5% (525/605) for the relatedness task.
The similarity and relatedness of the word pair showed a high correlation
(ρ=0.70, P<.001). The intraclass correlation coefficients to assess the
interrater agreements of the word pair sets were 0.47 on the similarity task and 
0.53 on the relatedness task. The final reference standard was 604 word pairs for
the similarity task and 599 word pairs for relatedness, excluding word pairs with
answers corresponding to outliers and word pairs that were answered by less than 
50% of all the respondents. When FastText models were applied to the final
reference standard word pair sets, the embedding models learning medical
documents had a higher correlation between the calculated cosine similarity
scores compared to human-judged similarity and relatedness scores (namu, ρ=0.12
vs with medical text for the similarity task, ρ=0.47; namu, ρ=0.02 vs with
medical text for the relatedness task, ρ=0.30).
CONCLUSIONS: Korean medical word pair reference standard sets for semantic
similarity and relatedness were developed based on medical documents from the
past 10 years. It is expected that our word pair reference sets will be actively 
utilized in the development of medical and multilingual natural language
processing technology in the future.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the phone reminder system 
on patient-centred TB treatment adherence during continuation phase, where
patients are responsible for taking medication at home.
METHODS: We conducted a two-arm randomised controlled trial on adult patients
with TB during the continuation phase. In the intervention arm, patients received
routine care plus phone-based weekly pill refilling and daily medication
reminders. In the control arm, participants received only routine care. A
covariate adaptive randomisation technique was used to balance covariates during 
allocation. The primary outcome was adherence to patient-centred TB treatment,
and secondary outcomes included provider-patient relationship and treatment
outcomes. We applied per-protocol and intention-to-treat analysis techniques.
RESULTS: We randomised 306 patients to intervention (n=152) and control (n=154)
groups. Adherence to patient-centred TB treatment was 79% (110/139) in
intervention and 66.4% (95/143) in control groups, with relative risk (RR) (95%
lower CI) (RR=1.632 (1.162 to ∞); p=0.018, one tailed). Good provider-patient
relationship was 73.3% (102/139) in intervention group and 52.4% (75/143) in
control group, p=0.0001. TB treatment success was 89.5% (136/152) in intervention
group and 85.1% (131/154) in control group, p=0.1238.
CONCLUSIONS: Mobile phone-based weekly refilling with daily medication reminder
system improved adherence to patient-centred TB treatment and provider-patient
relationship; however, there was no significant effect on treatment success.

BACKGROUND: Patients with single-ventricle physiology have a significant risk of 
cardiorespiratory deterioration between their first and second stage palliation
surgeries.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to develop and validate a real-time
computer algorithm that can automatically recognize physiological precursors of
cardiorespiratory deterioration in children with single-ventricle physiology
during their interstage hospitalization.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted from prospectively collected
physiological data of subjects with single-ventricle physiology. Deterioration
events were defined as a cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation
or an unplanned intubation. Physiological metrics were derived from the
electrocardiogram (heart rate, heart rate variability, ST-segment elevation, and 
ST-segment variability) and the photoplethysmogram (peripheral oxygen saturation 
and pleth variability index). A logistic regression model was trained to separate
the physiological dynamics of the pre-deterioration phase from all other data
generated by study subjects. Data were split 50/50 into model training and
validation sets to enable independent model validation.
RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 238 subjects admitted to the cardiac intensive
care unit and stepdown units of Texas Children's Hospital over a period of 6
years. Approximately 300,000 h of high-resolution physiological waveform and
vital sign data were collected using the Sickbay software platform (Medical
Informatics Corp., Houston, Texas). A total of 112 cardiorespiratory
deterioration events were observed. Seventy-two of the subjects experienced at
least 1 deterioration event. The risk index metric generated by our optimized
algorithm was found to be both sensitive and specific for detecting impending
events 1 to 2 h in advance of overt extremis (receiver-operating characteristic
curve area: 0.958; 95% confidence interval: 0.950 to 0.965).
CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm can provide 1 to 2 h of advanced warning for 62% of
all cardiorespiratory deterioration events in children with single-ventricle
physiology during their interstage period, with only 1 alarm being generated
at the bedside per patient per day.

PURPOSE: To analyse the profile of consultations made using an electronic
platform system (e-Interconsultation) of communication between the hospital
pharmacy service and primary care pharmacy units.
METHOD: Descriptive and retrospective analysis of the number and type of
e-Interconsultations for 3 years in a health area.
DATA SOURCE: data mining of the e-Interconsultation platform (Microsoft
Sharepoint software).
RESULTS: A total of 1152 interconsultations have been made and 90.6% (88.9%-92.4%
95% CI) solved. 477 (41.1%) of them were referrals from hospital care to primary 
care in addition to 675 (58.6%) from primary to hospital care. The validation of 
prescriptions and the need for drug monitoring in primary care are among the main
reasons for consultation.
CONCLUSION: This two-way electronic platform of communication is a good mechanism
that collaborates in patients' transit between different healthcare levels
because it allows us to facilitate, normalise and document consults, referrals
and pharmaceutical interventions between hospital care and primary care.
Therefore, it helps us provide better quality pharmaceutical care to our
patients.

OBJECTIVE: As master of science in health informatics (MSc HI) programs emerge in
developing countries, quality assurance of these programs is essential. This
article describes a comprehensive comparative analysis of competencies covered by
accredited MSc HI programs in the East African common labor and educational zone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two reviewers independently reviewed curricula from 7 of 8
accredited MSc HI university programs. The reviewers extracted covered
competencies, coding these based on a template that contained 73 competencies
derived from competencies recommended by the International Medical Informatics
Association, plus additional unique competencies contained within the MSc HI
programs. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the structure and
completion requirements of each MSc HI program. Jaccard similarity coefficient
was used to compare similarities in competency coverage between universities.
RESULTS: The total number of courses within the MSc HI degree programs ranged
from 8 to 22, with 35 to 180 credit hours. Cohen's kappa for coding competencies 
was 0.738. The difference in competency coverage was statistically significant
across the 7 institutions (P = .012), with covered competencies across
institutions ranging from 32 (43.8%) to 49 (67.1%) of 73. Only 4 (19%) of 21
university pairs met a cutoff of over 70% similarity in shared competencies.
DISCUSSION: Significant variations observed in competency coverage within MSc HI 
degree programs could limit mobility of student, faculty, and labor.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparative analysis of MSc HI degree programs across 7 universities
in East Africa revealed significant differences in the competencies that were
covered.

PURPOSE: To determine whether patient similarity in terms of head and neck cancer
spread through lymph nodes correlates significantly with radiation-associated
toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 582 head and neck cancer patients received radiotherapy
for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and had non-metastatic affected lymph nodes in the
head and neck. Affected lymph nodes were segmented from pretreatment
contrast-enhanced tomography scans and categorized according to consensus
guidelines. Similar patients were clustered into 4 groups according to a
graph-based representation of disease spread through affected lymph nodes.
Correlation between dysphagia-associated symptoms and patient groups was
calculated.
RESULTS: Out of 582 patients, 26% (152) experienced toxicity during a follow up
evaluation 6 months after completion of radiotherapy treatment. Patient groups
identified by our approach were significantly correlated with dysphagia, feeding 
tube, and aspiration toxicity (p < .0005).
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that structural geometry-aware characterization
of affected lymph nodes can be used to better predict radiation-associated
dysphagia at time of diagnosis, and better inform treatment guidelines.
CONCLUSION: Our work successfully stratified a patient cohort into similar groups
using a structural geometry, graph-encoding of affected lymph nodes in
oropharyngeal cancer patients, that were predictive of late radiation-associated

Machine learning (ML) is an area of artificial intelligence that provides
computer programmes with the capacity to autodidact and learn new skills from
experience, without continued human programming. ML algorithms can analyse large 
data sets quickly and accurately, by supervised and unsupervised learning
techniques, to provide classification and prediction value outputs. The
application of ML to chemical pathology can potentially enhance efficiency at all
phases of the laboratory's total testing process. Our review will broadly discuss
the theoretical foundation of ML in laboratory medicine. Furthermore, we will
explore the current applications of ML to diverse chemical pathology laboratory
processes, for example, clinical decision support, error detection in the
preanalytical phase, and ML applications in gel-based image analysis and
biomarker discovery. ML currently demonstrates exploratory applications in
chemical pathology with promising advancements, which have the potential to
improve all phases of the chemical pathology total testing pathway.

Using administrative data on all Veterans who enter Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) medical centres throughout the USA, this paper uses artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict mortality rates for patients with COVID-19 between
March and August 2020. First, using comprehensive data on over 10 000 Veterans'
medical history, demographics and lab results, we estimate five AI models. Our
XGBoost model performs the best, producing an area under the receive operator
characteristics curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87
and 0.41, respectively. We show how focusing on the performance of the AUROC
alone can lead to unreliable models. Second, through a unique collaboration with 
the Washington D.C. VA medical centre, we develop a dashboard that incorporates
these risk factors and the contributing sources of risk, which we deploy across
local VA medical centres throughout the country. Our results provide a concrete
example of how AI recommendations can be made explainable and practical for
clinicians and their interactions with patients.

This editorial aims to contribute to the current debate about the quality of
studies that apply machine learning (ML) methodologies to medical data to extract
value from them and provide clinicians with viable and useful tools supporting
everyday care practices. We propose a practical checklist to help authors to self
assess the quality of their contribution and to help reviewers to recognize and
appreciate high-quality medical ML studies by distinguishing them from the mere
application of ML techniques to medical data.

BACKGROUND: Empirically driven personalized diagnostic applications and treatment
stratification is widely perceived as a major hallmark in psychiatry. However,
databased personalized decision making requires standardized data acquisition and
data access, which are currently absent in psychiatric clinical routine.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we describe the informatics infrastructure implemented at the
psychiatric Münster University Hospital, which allows standardized acquisition,
transfer, storage, and export of clinical data for future real-time predictive
modelling in psychiatric routine.
METHODS: We designed and implemented a technical architecture that includes an
extension of the electronic health record (EHR) via scalable standardized data
collection and data transfer between EHRs and research databases, thus allowing
the pooling of EHRs and research data in a unified database and technical
solutions for the visual presentation of collected data and analyses results in
the EHR. The Single-source Metadata ARchitecture Transformation (SMA:T) was used 
as the software architecture. SMA:T is an extension of the EHR system and uses
module-driven engineering to generate standardized applications and interfaces.
The operational data model was used as the standard. Standardized data were
entered on iPads via the Mobile Patient Survey (MoPat) and the web application
Mopat@home, and the standardized transmission, processing, display, and export of
data were realized via SMA:T.
RESULTS: The technical feasibility of the informatics infrastructure was
demonstrated in the course of this study. We created 19 standardized
documentation forms with 241 items. For 317 patients, 6451 instances were
automatically transferred to the EHR system without errors. Moreover, 96,323
instances were automatically transferred from the EHR system to the research
database for further analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present the successful implementation of the
informatics infrastructure enabling standardized data acquisition and data access
for future real-time predictive modelling in clinical routine in psychiatry. The 
technical solution presented here might guide similar initiatives at other sites 
and thus help to pave the way toward future application of predictive models in
psychiatric clinical routine.

Background: In-hospital hyperglycemia (HH) is frequent and related to higher
morbidity and mortality. Despite the benefits of HH treatment, glycemic control
is often poor and neglected. The use of health applications to support diagnosis 
and therapy is now incorporated into medical practice. Medical applications for
inpatient glycemic management have potential to standardize this handling by the 
nonspecialist physician. However, related studies are scarce. We aim to evaluate 
the efficacy in inpatient glycemic control parameters of medical software
applications in non-critical care settings.
Methods: This systematic review on in-hospital insulin applications was performed
according to PRISMA guidelines. Data were extracted in triplicate and
methodological quality was verified. Specific outcomes of interest were glycemic 
control efficacy, hypoglycemia risk, length of in-hospital stay, integration with
the electronic medical record and healthcare staff acceptance.
Results: Among the 573 articles initially identified and subsequent revision of
the references of each one, seven studies involving six applications were
eligible for the review. A better glycemic control was reported with the use of
most in-hospital insulin applications in the studies evaluated, but there was no 
mention of the time to reach the glycemic goal. The risk of hypoglycemia was low.
Different reasons influenced the varied acceptance of the use of applications
among health professionals.
Conclusion: The six applications of inpatient insulin therapy in a non-critical
care environment proved to be useful and safe compared to the usual management.
Medical apps are tools that can help improve the quality of patient care.

Paediatric disorders of impaired linear growth are challenging to manage, in part
because of delays in the identification of pathological short stature and
subsequent referral and diagnosis, the requirement for long-term therapy, and
frequent poor adherence to treatment, notably with human growth hormone (hGH).
Digital health technologies hold promise for improving outcomes in paediatric
growth disorders by supporting personalisation of care, from diagnosis to
treatment and follow up. The value of automated systems in monitoring linear
growth in children has been demonstrated in Finland, with findings that such a
system is more effective than a traditional manual system for early diagnosis of 
abnormal growth. Artificial intelligence has potential to resolve problems of
variability that may occur during analysis of growth information, and augmented
reality systems have been developed that aim to educate patients and caregivers
about growth disorders and their treatment (such as injection techniques for hGH 
administration). Adherence to hGH treatment is often suboptimal, which negatively
impacts the achievement of physical and psychological benefits of the treatment. 
Personalisation of adherence support necessitates capturing individual patient
adherence data; the use of technology to assist with this is exemplified by the
use of an electronic injection device, which shares real-time recordings of the
timing, date and dose of hGH delivered to the patient with the clinician, via
web-based software. The use of an electronic device is associated with high
levels of adherence to hGH treatment and improved growth outcomes. It can be
anticipated that future technological advances, coupled with continued 'human
interventions' from healthcare providers, will further improve management of
paediatric growth disorders.

The COVID-19 outbreak exposed several problems faced by health systems worldwide,
especially concerning the safe and rapid generation and sharing of health data.
However, this pandemic scenario has also facilitated the rapid implementation and
monitoring of technologies in the health field. In view of the occurrence of the 
public emergency caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil, the Department of Informatics of
the Brazilian Unified Health System created a contingency plan. In this paper, we
aim to report the digital health strategies applied in Brazil and the first
results obtained during the fight against COVID-19. Conecte SUS, a platform
created to store all the health data of an individual throughout their life, is
the center point of the Brazilian digital strategy. Access to the platform can be
obtained through an app by the patient and the health professionals involved in
the case. Health data sharing became possible due to the creation of the National
Health Data Network (Rede Nacional de Dados em Saúde, RNDS). A mobile app was
developed to guide citizens regarding the need to go to a health facility and to 
assist in disseminating official news about the virus. The mobile app can also
alert the user if they have had contact with an infected person. The official
numbers of cases and available hospital beds are updated and published daily on a
website containing interactive graphs. These data are obtained due to creating a 
web-based notification system that uses the RNDS to share information about the
cases. Preclinical care through telemedicine has become essential to prevent
overload in health facilities. The exchange of experiences between medical teams 
from large centers and small hospitals was made possible using telehealth. Brazil
took a giant step toward digital health adoption, creating and implementing
important initiatives; however, these initiatives do not yet cover the entire
health system. It is expected that the sharing of health data that are maintained
and authorized by the patient will become a reality in the near future. The
intention is to obtain better clinical outcomes, cost reduction, and faster and
better services in the public health network.

BACKGROUND: Older adults face growing health care needs and could potentially
benefit from personal health information management (PHIM) and PHIM technology.
To ensure effective PHIM and to provide supportive tools, it is crucial to
investigate the needs, challenges, processes, and tools used by this
subpopulation. The literature on PHIM by older adults, however, remains scattered
and has not provided a clear picture of what we know about the elements that play
a role in older adults' PHIM.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of our review was to provide a comprehensive overview of
extant knowledge on PHIM by older adults, establish the status quo of research on
this topic, and identify research gaps.
METHODS: We carried out a scoping review of the literature from 1998 to 2020,
which followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework. First, we
executed a broad and structured search. We then carried out a qualitative
analysis of papers pertinent to the topic taking into consideration the five
elements of the patient work system as follows: (1) personal-level factors, (2)
PHIM tasks, (3) tools used, (4) physical settings of PHIM activities, and (5)
socio-organizational aspects.
RESULTS: The review included 22 studies. Consolidated empirical evidence was
related to all elements of the patient work system. Multiple personal factors
affected PHIM. Various types of personal health information were managed
(clinical, patient-generated, and general) and tools were used (electronic,
paper-based, and others). Older adults' PHIM was intertwined with their
surroundings, and various individuals participated. The largest body of evidence 
concerned personal factors, while findings regarding the physical environment of 
PHIM were scarce. Most research has thus far examined older adults as a single
group, and scant attention has been paid to age subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities for further PHIM studies remain across all elements of
the patient work system in terms of empirical, design science, or review work.

PURPOSE: To assess how primary care practitioners use reports of general health
care (GHC) and primary care (PC) research and how well reports deliver what they 
need to inform clinical practice.
METHODS: International, interprofessional online survey, 2019, of primary care
clinicians who see patients at least half time. Respondents used frequency scales
to report how often they access both GHC and PC research and how frequently
reports meet needs. Free-text short comments recorded comments and suggestions.
RESULTS: Survey yielded 252 respondents across 29 nations, 55% (121) women,
including 88% (195) physicians, nurses 5% (11), and physician assistants 3% (7). 
Practitioners read research reports frequently but find they usually fail to meet
their needs. For PC research, 33% (77) accessed original reports in academic
journals weekly or daily, and 36% found reports meet needs "frequently" or
"always." They access reports of GHC research slightly more often but find them
somewhat less useful.
CONCLUSIONS: PC practitioners access original research in academic journals
frequently but find reports meet information needs less than half the time. PC
research reflects the unique PC setting and so reporting has distinct focus,
needs, and challenges. Practitioners desire improved reporting of study context, 
interventions, relationships, generalizability, and implementation.

BACKGROUND: Intraoperative data may improve models predicting postoperative
events. We evaluated the effect of incorporating intraoperative variables to the 
existing preoperative model on the predictive performance of the model for
coronary artery bypass graft.
METHODS: We analyzed 378 572 isolated coronary artery bypass graft cases
performed across 1083 centers, using the national Society of Thoracic Surgeons
Adult Cardiac Surgery Database between 2014 and 2016. Outcomes were operative
mortality, 5 postoperative complications, and composite representation of all
events. We fitted models by logistic regression or extreme gradient boosting
(XGBoost). For each modeling approach, we used preoperative only, intraoperative 
only, or pre+intraoperative variables. We developed 84 models with unique
combinations of the 3 variable sets, 2 variable selection methods, 2 modeling
approaches, and 7 outcomes. Each model was tested in 20 iterations of 70:30
stratified random splitting into development/testing samples. Model performances 
were evaluated on the testing dataset using the C statistic, area under the
precision-recall curve, and calibration metrics, including the Brier score.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 65.3 years, and 24.7% were women. Operative
mortality, excluding intraoperative death, occurred in 1.9%. In all outcomes,
models that considered pre+intraoperative variables demonstrated significantly
improved Brier score and area under the precision-recall curve compared with
models considering pre or intraoperative variables alone. XGBoost without
external variable selection had the best C statistics, Brier score, and area
under the precision-recall curve values in 4 of the 7 outcomes (mortality, renal 
failure, prolonged ventilation, and composite) compared with logistic regression 
models with or without variable selection. Based on the calibration plots, risk
restratification for mortality showed that the logistic regression model
underestimated the risk in 11 114 patients (9.8%) and overestimated in 12 005
patients (10.6%). In contrast, the XGBoost model underestimated the risk in 7218 
patients (6.4%) and overestimated in 0 patients (0%).
CONCLUSIONS: In isolated coronary artery bypass graft, adding intraoperative
variables to preoperative variables resulted in improved predictions of all 7
outcomes. Risk models based on XGBoost may provide a better prediction of adverse

BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, major shortcomings in the way mental 
health care systems were organized were impairing the delivery of effective care.
The mental health impacts of the pandemic, the recession, and the resulting
social dislocation will depend on the extent to which care systems will become
overwhelmed and on the strategic investments made across the system to
effectively respond.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of strengthening the mental
health system through technology-enabled care coordination on mental health and
suicide outcomes.
METHODS: A system dynamics model for the regional population catchment of North
Coast New South Wales, Australia, was developed that incorporated defined
pathways from social determinants of mental health to psychological distress,
mental health care, and suicidal behavior. The model reproduced historic time
series data across a range of outcomes and was used to evaluate the relative
impact of a set of scenarios on attempted suicide (ie, self-harm
hospitalizations), suicide deaths, mental health-related emergency department
(ED) presentations, and psychological distress over the period from 2021 to 2030.
These scenarios include (1) business as usual, (2) increase in service capacity
growth rate by 20%, (3) standard telehealth, and (4) technology-enabled care
coordination. Each scenario was tested using both pre- and post-COVID-19 social
and economic conditions.
RESULTS: Technology-enabled care coordination was forecast to deliver a reduction
in self-harm hospitalizations and suicide deaths by 6.71% (95% interval
5.63%-7.87%), mental health-related ED presentations by 10.33% (95% interval
8.58%-12.19%), and the prevalence of high psychological distress by 1.76
percentage points (95% interval 1.35-2.32 percentage points). Scenario testing
demonstrated that increasing service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard
telehealth had substantially lower impacts. This pattern of results was
replicated under post-COVID-19 conditions with technology-enabled care
coordination being the only tested scenario, which was forecast to reduce the
negative impact of the pandemic on mental health and suicide.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of technology-enabled care coordination is likely to improve
mental health and suicide outcomes. The substantially lower effectiveness of
targeting individual components of the mental health system (ie, increasing
service capacity growth rate by 20% or standard telehealth) reiterates that
strengthening the whole system has the greatest impact on patient outcomes.
Investments into more of the same types of programs and services alone will not
be enough to improve outcomes; instead, new models of care and the digital
infrastructure to support them and their integration are needed.

Health behaviors affect health status in cancer survivors. We hypothesized that
nonlinear algorithms would identify distinct key health behaviors compared to a
linear algorithm and better classify cancer survivors. We aimed to use three
nonlinear algorithms to identify such key health behaviors and compare their
performances with that of a logistic regression for distinguishing cancer
survivors from those without cancer in a population-based cohort study. We used
six health behaviors and three socioeconomic factors for analysis. Participants
from the Lifelines population-based cohort were binary classified into a
cancer-survivors group and a cancer-free group using either nonlinear algorithms 
or logistic regression, and their performances were compared by the area under
the curve (AUC). In addition, we performed case-control analyses (matched by age,
sex, and education level) to evaluate classification performance only by health
behaviors. Data were collected for 107,624 cancer free participants and 2760
cancer survivors. Using all variables resulted an AUC of 0.75 ± 0.01, using only 
six health behaviors, the logistic regression and nonlinear algorithms
differentiated cancer survivors from cancer-free participants with AUCs of 0.62 ±
0.01 and 0.60 ± 0.01, respectively. The main distinctive classifier was age.
Though not relevant to classification, the main distinctive health behaviors were
body mass index and alcohol consumption. In the case-control analyses, algorithms
produced AUCs of 0.52 ± 0.01. No key health behaviors were identified by linear
and nonlinear algorithms to differentiate cancer survivors from cancer-free
participants in this population-based cohort.

Objective: The digitalization of the healthcare system poses new challenges for
physicians. Thus, the relevance of learning digital competencies (DiCo), such as 
dealing with data sets, apply telemedicine or using apps, is already growing in
medical education. DiCo should be clearly separated from digitized teaching
formats, which have been increasingly used since the COVID 19 pandemic. This
article outlines the faculties in Germany where DiCo are already integrated into 
medical education. Methods: Courses with DiCo as teaching content were collected 
by a literature research on Pubmed and Google as well as by contacting all dean's
offices and other persons responsible for teaching at German medical faculties.
The courses were summarized in a table. Results: In a first survey, 16
universities were identified that offer courses on DiCo. In the elective area at 
the universities, 17 courses and in the compulsory area eight courses could be
identified. The scope and content of the courses diverged between compulsory
curricula, integrated courses of different lengths, and elective courses that are
one-time or longitudinally integrated. The topics taught are heterogeneous and
include fundamentals of medical informatics such as data management on the one
hand and a collection of e.g. ethics, law, apps, artificial intelligence,
telemedicine and robotics on the other hand. Conclusion: Currently, only some
German medical faculties offer courses on DiCo. These courses vary in scope and
design. They are frequently part of the elective curriculum and only reach some
of the students. The possibility of embedding DiCo in the already existing
cross-sectional area appears limited. In view of the ongoing digitalization of
healthcare, it is necessary to make future courses on DiCo accessible to all
medical students. In order to drive this expansion forward, the implementation of
the new learning objectives catalogue, in which DiCo are integrated, a network
formation, a teaching qualification as well as the involvement of students is
recommended.

Publisher: Zielsetzung: Die Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens stellt
Ärztinnen und Ärzte vor neue Herausforderungen. Somit wächst die Relevanz des
Erlernens von Digitalen Kompetenzen (DiKo), wie z.B. Kenntnisse im Umgang mit
Datenmengen, Telemedizin oder Apps, bereits im Medizinstudium. DiKo sind hierbei 
klar zu trennen von digitalisierten Lehrformaten, die seit der COVID 19-Pandemie 
vermehrt eingesetzt wurden. Dieser Artikel beschreibt, an welchen Fakultäten in
Deutschland digitale Kompetenzen bereits in die Medizinische Ausbildung
integriert sind. Methodik: Über eine Literaturrecherche auf Pubmed und Google
sowie durch den Kontakt zu allen Dekanaten und weiteren Lehrverantwortlichen
deutscher medizinischer Fakultäten wurden Lehrveranstaltungen, die DiKo als
Lehrinhalt aufweisen, gesammelt und in einer Tabelle zusammengefasst.Ergebnisse: 
In einer ersten stichprobenartigen Übersicht wurden 16 Universitäten
identifiziert, die Lehrveranstaltungen zu DiKo anbieten. Im Wahlpflichtbereich
konnten 17 Universitäten und im Pflichtbereich acht Universitäten identifiziert
werden. Der Umfang und die inhaltliche Ausgestaltung der Lehrveranstaltungen
divergiert zwischen Pflichtcurricula, integrierten Lehrveranstaltungen
verschiedener Größe und Wahlpflichtveranstaltungen, die einmalig oder
longitudinal integriert sind. Die gelehrten Themen sind heterogen und umfassen
einerseits Grundlagen der medizinischen Informatik, wie z.B. Datenmanagement und 
andererseits eine Sammlung aus z.B. Ethik, Recht, Apps, Künstlicher Intelligenz, 
Telemedizin und Robotik. Schlussfolgerung: Aktuell werden nur an einem Teil der
deutschen medizinischen Fakultäten Lehrveranstaltungen zu DiKo angeboten. Diese
Veranstaltungen divergieren in Umfang und Ausgestaltung. Sie sind häufig im
Wahlpflichtbereich angesiedelt und erreichen nur einen Teil der Studierenden.
Eine Verankerung von DiKo im bereits vorhandenen Querschnittsbereich erscheint
begrenzt. Angesichts der fortschreitenden Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens
ist es notwendig, zukünftige Lehrveranstaltungen zu DiKo allen
Medizinstudierenden zugänglich zu machen. Um diesen Ausbau zügig voranzutreiben
wird die Umsetzung des neuen Lernzielkatalog, in den DiKo integriert sind, eine
Netzwerkbildung, eine Lehrendenqualifikation sowie die Einbindung Studierender
empfohlen.

BACKGROUND: The recent, rapid development of digital technologies offers new
possibilities for more efficient implementation of electronic health record (EHR)
and personal health record (PHR) systems. A growing volume of healthcare data has
been the hallmark of this digital transformation. The large healthcare datasets' 
complexity and their dynamic nature pose various challenges related to
processing, analysis, storage, security, privacy, data exchange, and usability.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to 
assess technological progress in EHR and PHR systems. We searched MEDLINE,
Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for systematic literature reviews on
technological advancements that support EHR and PHR systems published between
January 1, 2010, and October 06, 2020.
RESULTS: The searches resulted in a total of 2,448 hits. Of these, we finally
selected 23 systematic reviews. Most of the included papers dealt with
information extraction tools and natural language processing technology (n = 10),
followed by studies that assessed the use of blockchain technology in healthcare 
(n = 8). Other areas of digital technology research included EHR and PHR systems 
in austere settings (n = 1), de-identification methods (n = 1), visualization
techniques (n = 1), communication tools within EHR and PHR systems (n = 1), and
methodologies for defining Clinical Information Models that promoted EHRs and
PHRs interoperability (n = 1).
CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements can improve the efficiency in the
implementation of EHR and PHR systems in numerous ways. Natural language
processing techniques, either rule-based, machine-learning, or deep
learning-based, can extract information from clinical narratives and other
unstructured data locked in EHRs and PHRs, allowing secondary research (i.e.,
phenotyping). Moreover, EHRs and PHRs are expected to be the primary
beneficiaries of the blockchain technology implementation on Health Information
Systems. Governance regulations, lack of trust, poor scalability, security,
privacy, low performance, and high cost remain the most critical challenges for
implementing these technologies.

In the era of translational research, data integration and clinical data
warehouses are important enabling technologies for clinical researchers. The OMOP
common data model is a wide-spread choice as a target for data integration in
medical informatics. It's portability of queries and analyses across different
institutions and data are ideal also from the viewpoint of the FAIR principles.
Yet, the OMOP CDM lacks a simple and intuitive user interface for untrained users
to run simple queries for feasibility analysis. Aim of this study is to provide
an algorithm to translate any given i2b2 query to an equivalent query which can
then be run on the OMOP CDM database. The provided algorithm is able to convert
queries created in the i2b2 webclient to SQL statements which can be executed on 
a standard OMOP CDM database programmatically.

Electronic documentation of medication data is one of the biggest challenges
associated with digital clinical documentation. Despite its importance, it has
not been consistently implemented in German university hospitals. In this paper
we describe the approach of the German Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)
towards the modelling of a medication core dataset using FHIR® profiles and
standard-compliant terminologies. The FHIR profiles for Medication and
MedicationStatement were adapted to the core dataset of the MIl. The
terminologies to be used were selected based on the criteria of the ISO-standard 
for the Identification of Medicinal Products (IDMP). For a first use case with a 
minimal medication dataset, the entries in the medication chapter of the German
Procedure Classification (OPS codes) were analyzed and mapped to IDMP-compliant
medication terminology. OPS data are available at all German hospitals as they
are mandatory for reimbursement purposes. Reimbursement-relevant encounter data
containing OPS medication procedures were used to create a FHIR representation
based on the FHIR profiles MedicationStatement and Medication. This minimal
solution includes - besides the details on patient and start-/end-dates - the
active ingredients identified by the IDMP-compliant codes and - if specified in
the OPS code - the route of administration and the range of the amount of
substance administered to the patient, using the appropriate unit of measurement 
code. With FHIR, the medication data can be represented in the data integration
centers of the MII to provide a standardized format for data analysis across the 
MII sites.

Semantic interoperability is a major challenge in multi-center data sharing
projects, a challenge that the German Initiative for Medical Informatics is
taking up. With respect to laboratory data, enriching site-specific tests and
measurements with LOINC codes appears to be a crucial step in supporting
cross-institutional research. However, this effort is very time-consuming, as it 
requires expert knowledge of local site specifics. To ease this process, we
developed a generic manual collaborative terminology mapping tool, the MIRACUM
Mapper. It allows the creation of arbitrary mapping workflows involving different
user roles. A mapping workflow with two user roles has been implemented at
University Hospital Erlangen to support the local LOINC mapping. Additionally,
the MIRACUM LabVisualizeR provides summary statistics and visualizations of
analyte data. We developed a toolbox that facilitates the collaborative creation 
of mappings and streamlines the review as well as the validation process. The two
tools are available under an open source license.

Accessing secondary-use healthcare data in Germany requires contracting with each
organization that acts as a data provider. The SMITH Service Platform offers a
central access point for scientists, facilitating contracting as part of an
integrated data use and access process with several Data Integration Centers
(DIC) at once. Process support is realized by a central Business Process Engine
(BPE), which manages process definition and process control, combined with a
central IHE infrastructure. The use of IHE XDS and IHE XDW profiles enables the
exchange of process instance information with multiple distributed visualization 
and user interaction tools for provided user tasks based on international
standards. User task information include structured forms for submitting
instructions and results as task input and output for the users, and are
synchronized between the shared process instance and the BPE. A reference user
interface is also provided with the SMITH Marketplace. In the future, further
standardization efforts regarding the structured forms and the use of the IHE XDW
profile should be pursued.

Medical routine data promises to add value for research. However, the transfer of
this data into a research context is difficult. Therefore, Medical Data
Integration Centers are being set up to merge data from primary information
systems in a central repository. But, data from one organization is rarely
sufficient to answer a research question. The data must be merged beyond
institutional boundaries. In order to use this data in a specific research
project, a researcher must have the possibility to query available cohort sizes
across institutions. A possible solution for this requirement is presented in
this paper, using a process for fully automated and distributed feasibility
queries (i.e. cohort size estimations). This process is executed according to the
open standard BPMN 2.0, the underlying process data model is based on HL7 FHIR R4
resources. The proposed solution is currently being deployed at eight university 
hospitals and one trusted third party across Germany.

Several standards and frameworks have been described in existing literature and
technical manuals that contribute to solving the interoperability problem. Their 
data models usually focus on clinical data and only support healthcare delivery
processes. Research processes including cross organizational cohort size
estimation, approvals and reviews of research proposals, consent checks, record
linkage and pseudonymization need to be supported within the HiGHmed medical
informatics consortium. The open source HiGHmed Data Sharing Framework implements
a distributed business process engine for executing arbitrary biomedical research
and healthcare processes modeled and executed using BPMN 2.0 while exchanging
information using FHIR R4 resources. The proposed reference implementation is
currently being rolled out to eight university hospitals in Germany as well as a 
trusted third party and available open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

ISO 21526 Conform Metadata Editor for FAIR Unicode SKOS Thesauri.

Author information: 
(1)UGMLC, German Center for Lung Research (DZL), Justus-Liebig-University,
Giessen, Germany.

Metadata repositories are an indispensable component of data integration
infrastructures and support semantic interoperability between knowledge
organization systems. Standards for metadata representation like the ISO/IEC
11179 as well as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Simple
Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) by the World Wide Web Consortium were
published to ensure metadata interoperability, maintainability and
sustainability. The FAIR guidelines were composed to explicate those aspects in
four principles divided in fifteen sub-principles. The ISO/IEC 21526 standard
extends the 11179 standard for the domain of health care and mandates that SKOS
be used for certain scenarios. In medical informatics, the composition of health 
care SKOS classification schemes is often managed by documentalists and data
scientists. They use editors, which support them in producing comprehensive and
valid metadata. Current metadata editors either do not properly support the SKOS 
resource annotations, require server applications or make use of additional
databases for metadata storage. These characteristics are contrary to the
application independency and versatility of raw Unicode SKOS files, e.g. the
custom text arrangement, extensibility or copy & paste editing. We provide an
application that adds navigation, auto completion and validity check capabilities
on top of a regular Unicode text editor.

Clinical data and above all individual patient data are highly sensitive. All the
more it is important to protect these critical information while analyzing and
exploring their specifics for further research. However, in order to enable
students and other researchers to develop decision support systems and to use
modern data analysis methods such as intelligent pattern recognition, the
provision of clinical data is essential. In order to allow this while completely 
protecting the privacy of a patient, we present a mixed approach to generate
semantically and clinically realistic data: (1) We use available synthetic data, 
extract information on patient visits and diagnoses and adapt them to the
encoding systems of German claims data; (2) based on a statistical analysis of
real German hospital data, we identify distributions of procedures, laboratory
data and other measurements and transfer them to the synthetic patient's visits
and diagnoses in a semi-automated way. This enabled us to provide students a data
set that is as semantically and clinically realistic as possible to apply
patient-level prediction algorithms within the development of clinical decision
support systems without putting patient data at any risk.

The diagnosis of patients with rare diseases is often delayed. A Clinical
Decision Support System using similarity analysis of patient-based data may have 
the potential to support the diagnosis of patients with rare diseases. This
qualitative study has the objective to investigate how the result of a patient
similarity analysis should be presented to a physician to enable diagnosis
support. We conducted a focus group with physicians practicing in rare diseases
as well as medical informatics researchers. To prepare the focus group, a
literature search was performed to check the current state of research regarding 
visualization of similar patients. We then created software-mockups for the
presentation of these visualization methods for the discussion within the focus
group. Two persons took independently field notes for data collection of the
focus group. A questionnaire was distributed to the participants to rate the
visualization methods. The results show that four visualization methods are
promising for the visualization of similar patients: "Patient on demand table",
"Criteria selection", "Time-Series chart" and "Patient timeline. "Patient on
demand table" shows a direct comparison of patient characteristics, whereas
"Criteria selection" allows the selection of different patient criteria to get
deeper insights into the data. The "Time-Series chart" shows the time course of
clinical parameters (e.g. blood pressure) whereas a "Patient timeline" indicates 
which time events exist for a patient (e.g. several symptoms on different dates).
In the future, we will develop a software-prototype of the Clinical Decision
Support System to include the visualization methods and evaluate the clinical
usage.

Handoffs in patient care responsibilities between practitioners are common in the
hospital setting. Because inadequate communication can lead to patient harm,
professional organizations have published recommendations and practical guides to
support standardized workflow. However, currently available electronic medical
record (EMR) tools rarely provide the requisite functionality to support work and
often suffer from major usability flaws. Our internal medicine residency program 
sponsored a quality improvement initiative to improve the design of handoff
tools. To support this initiative, our medical informatics program collaborated
with a school of architecture and design to identify requirements and ideate
interface prototypes. In this article, we describe how we used Design Thinking
principles and methods to inform our product design lifecycle, create novel
designs, and teach inter-professional students health systems science concepts.

The increasing digitalization of medicine stressed the importance of teaching
digital competencies in undergraduate medical education. However, in many medical
curricula in Germany, medical informatics is underrepresented. Due the upcoming
reorganization of medical undergraduate education in Germany, topics previously
assigned to medical informatics represent curricular challenges for all medical
disciplines. Against this background, experiences from the project DigiWissMed
show how medical informatics can support the teaching of digital competencies in 
all disciplines of medical education. Therefore, interdisciplinary teaching teams
of medical informatics professionals and physicians were formed. In different
academic years, this teaching teams jointly designed and implemented new seminars
to convey digital competencies. The seminars covers topics such as technology
acceptance, telemedicine and assistive health care related to the medical
specialty. So, in the project DigiWissMed, the practicability and usefulness of
interdisciplinary teaching teams to convey digital competencies could be
demonstrate. In the digitalization process of medicine, medical informatics plays
a key role. For future-proof medical education, experts of this field should be
involved in teaching digital competencies, too.

HiGHmed is a German Consortium where eight University Hospitals have agreed to
the cross-institutional data exchange through novel medical informatics
solutions. The HiGHmed Use Case Infection Control group has modelled a set of
infection-related data in the openEHR format. In order to establish
interoperability with the other German Consortia belonging to the same national
initiative, we mapped the openEHR information to the Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format recommended within the initiative. FHIR 
enables fast exchange of data thanks to the discrete and independent data
elements into which information is organized. Furthermore, to explore the
possibility of maximizing analysis capabilities for our data set, we subsequently
mapped the FHIR elements to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common
Data Model (OMOP CDM). The OMOP data model is designed to support the conduct of 
research to identify and evaluate associations between interventions and outcomes
caused by these interventions. Mapping across standard allows to exploit their
peculiarities while establishing and/or maintaining interoperability. This
article provides an overview of our experience in mapping infection control
related data across three different standards openEHR, FHIR and OMOP CDM.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
Problems (ICD) is one of the widely used classification system for diagnoses and 
procedures to assign diagnosis codes to Electronic Health Record (EHR) associated
with a patient's stay. The aim of this paper is to propose an automated coding
system to assist physicians in the assignment of ICD codes to EHR. For this
purpose, we created a pipeline of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep
Learning (DL) models able to extract the useful information from French medical
texts and to perform classification. After the evaluation phase, our approach was
able to predict 346 diagnosis codes from heterogeneous medical units with an
accuracy average of 83%. Our results were finally validated by physicians of the 
Medical Information Department (MID) in charge of coding hospital stays.

cBioPortal is a commonly used data warehousing solution for genomic cancer
studies. The software is being extended for patient care application in a
molecular tumor board by the MIRACUM consortium within the Medical Informatics
Initiative Germany. A key feature for this use case is the ability to enter
therapy recommendations for individual patients, which requires interoperability 
with the hospital information system. A RESTful interface between cBioPortal and 
an external mediation layer was selected from the different implementation
options. It achieves interoperability by using a FHIR capable server to store
data and applying the HL7 FHIR Genomics Reporting implementation guide. For
systems not supporting the FHIR standard, the well-established HL7 Version 2
standard is available as a fallback export format.

The current movement in Medical Informatics towards comprehensive Electronic
Health Records (EHRs) has enabled a wide range of secondary use cases for this
data. However, due to a number of well-justified concerns and barriers,
especially with regards to information privacy, access to real medical records by
researchers is often not possible, and indeed not always required. An appealing
alternative to the use of real patient data is the employment of a generator for 
realistic, yet synthetic, EHRs. However, we have identified a number of
shortcomings in prior works, especially with regards to the adaptability of the
projects to the requirements of the German healthcare system. Based on three case
studies, we define a non-exhaustive list of requirements for an ideal generator
project that can be used in a wide range of localities and settings, to address
and enable future work in this regard.

Clinical trials are carried out to prove the safety and effectiveness of new
interventions and therapies. As diseases and their causes continue to become more
specific, so do inclusion and exclusion criteria for trials. Patient recruitment 
has always been a challenge, but with medical progress, it becomes increasingly
difficult to achieve the necessary number of cases. In Germany, the Medical
Informatics Initiative is planning to use the central application and
registration office to conduct feasibility analyses at an early stage and thus to
identify suitable project partners. This approach aims to technically
adapt/integrate the envisioned infrastructure in such a way that it can be used
for trial case number estimation for the planning of multicenter clinical trials.
We have developed a fully automated solution called APERITIF that can identify
the number of eligible patients based on free-text eligibility criteria, taking
into account the MII core data set and based on the FHIR standard. The evaluation
showed a precision of 62.64 % for inclusion criteria and a precision of 66.45 %
for exclusion criteria.

Data integration is an increasing need in medical informatics projects like the
EU Precise4Q project, in which multidisciplinary semantically and syntactically
heterogeneous data across several institutions needs to be integrated. Besides,
data sharing agreements often allow a virtual data integration only, because data
cannot leave the source repository. We propose a data harmonization
infrastructure in which data is virtually integrated by sharing a semantically
rich common data representation that allows their homogeneous querying. This
common data model integrates content from well-known biomedical ontologies like
SNOMED CT by using the BTL2 upper level ontology, and is imported into a graph
database. We successfully integrated three datasets and made some test queries
showing the feasibility of the approach.

With the increased use of patient portals in acute and chronic care settings as a
strategy to support patient care and improve patient-centric care, there is still
little known about the impact of patient portals in mental health contexts. The
purposes of this review were to: 1) identify the critical success factors for
successful patient portal implementation and adoption among end-users that could 
be utilized in a mental health setting; 2) uncover what we know about existing
mental health portals and their effectiveness for end-users; and 3) determine
what indicators are being used to evaluate existing patient portals for end-users
that may be applied in a mental health context. This scoping review was conducted
through a search of six electronic databases including Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
and CINAHL for articles published between 2007 and 2021. A total of 31 articles
were included in the review. Critical success factors of patient portal
implementation included those related to education, usefulness, usability,
culture, and resources. Only two patient portals had articles published related
to their effectiveness for end-users (one in Canada and the other in the United
States). More than 100 measures of process (n = 73) and outcome (n = 59)
indicators were extracted from the studies and mapped to the Benefits Evaluation 
Framework. Patient portals carry great potential to improve patient care, but
more attention needs to be given to ensure they are being evaluated through the
development and implementation phases with the end-users in mind. Further
understanding of process indicators relating to use are essential for long-term
patient adoption of portals to obtain their potential benefits.

The Internet of Things (IoT) applied to the treatment of cancer patients has been
explored and the results are promising. This review aims to identify the
applications and benefits of using IoT techniques, especially wearable devices,
on the management of the adverse effects and symptoms, quality of life, and
survival in cancer patients undergoing active treatment. The work also presents
the architecture and taxonomy of the use of IoT, the challenges and the relevant 
results, as well as the association of the collected information with the type of
treatment and the type of cancer. This study was based on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and considered articles
from the last 10 years. Specific and general research questions and the PICOS
approach were used to define the search string and to guide the selection of
articles. The search retrieved 1678 publications, of which 121 were included for 
a full review. 67% of selected studies addressed the monitoring and follow-up of 
physical activities and their associations with the adverse effects and symptoms 
related to cancer treatment. Besides, 53% evaluated sleep patterns, heart rate,
and oxygen saturation levels. One-third of the studies assessed patients with the
indication for surgery and about one-half evaluated patients undergoing
chemotherapy. Furthermore, the IoT allowed verifying associations of human
behaviors with adverse effects and quality of life. IoT was observed to
contribute to monitoring cancer patients, improve their quality of life and
manage adverse effects related to cancer treatment. 53% were pilot studies and
93% were published in the last 5 years, which demonstrates to be a recent issue
and therefore still has a lot to be explored.

OBJECTIVES: Electronic health records (EHR) are receiving growing attention from 
regulators, biopharmaceuticals and payors as a potential source of real-world
evidence. However, their suitability for the study of diseases with complex
activity measures is unclear. We sought to evaluate the use of EHR data for
estimating treatment effectiveness in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), using
tofacitinib as a use case.
METHODS: Records from the University of California, San Francisco (6/2012 to
4/2019) were queried to identify tofacitinib-treated IBD patients. Disease
activity variables at baseline and follow-up were manually abstracted according
to a preregistered protocol. The proportion of patients meeting the endpoints of 
recent randomised trials in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) was 
assessed.
RESULTS: 86 patients initiated tofacitinib. Baseline characteristics of the
real-world and trial cohorts were similar, except for universal failure of tumour
necrosis factor inhibitors in the former. 54% (UC) and 62% (CD) of patients had
complete capture of disease activity at baseline (month -6 to 0), while only 32% 
(UC) and 69% (CD) of patients had complete follow-up data (month 2 to 8). Using
data imputation, we estimated the proportion achieving the trial primary
endpoints as being similar to the published estimates for both UC (16%, p
value=0.5) and CD (38%, p-value=0.8).
DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This pilot study reproduced trial-based estimates of
tofacitinib efficacy despite its use in a different cohort but revealed
substantial missingness in routinely collected data. Future work is needed to
strengthen EHR data and enable real-world evidence in complex diseases like IBD.

Early detection of sepsis can facilitate early clinical intervention with
effective treatment and may reduce sepsis mortality rates. In view of this,
machine learning-based automated diagnosis of sepsis using easily recordable
physiological data can be more promising as compared to the gold standard
rule-based clinical criteria in current practice. This study aims to develop such
a machine learning framework that demonstrates the quantification of
heterogeneity within the tabular electronic health records (EHR) data of clinical
covariates to capture both linear relationships and nonlinear correlation for the
early prediction of sepsis. Here, the statistics of pairwise association for each
hour-covariate pair within the EHR data for every 6-hours window-duration with
selected 24 covariates is described using pointwise mutual information (PMI)
matrix. This matrix gives the heterogeneity of data as a two-dimensional map.
Such matrices are fused horizontally along the z-axis as vertical slices in the
xy plane to form a 3-way tensor for each record with the corresponding Length of 
Stay (L). Tensor factorization of such fused tensor for every record is performed
using Tucker decomposition, and only the core tensors are retained later,
excluding the 3 unitary matrices to provide the latent feature set for the
prediction of sepsis onset. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is employed
wherein the obtained 120 latent features from the reshaped core tensor, are fed
to Light Gradient Boosting Machine Learning models (LightGBM) for binary
classification, further alleviating the involved class imbalance. The
machine-learning framework is designed via Bayesian optimization, yielding an
average normalized utility score of 0.4519 as defined by challenge organizers and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.8621 on
publicly available PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 training
data. The proposed tensor decomposition of 3-way fused tensor formulated using
PMI matrices leverages higher-order temporal interactions between the pairwise
associations among the clinical values for early prediction of sepsis. This is
validated with improved risk prediction power for every hour of admission to the 
ICU in terms of utility score, AUROC, and F1 score. The results obtained show a
significant improvement particularly in terms of utility score of ~1.5-2% under a
5-fold cross-validation scheme on entire training data as compared to a top
entrant research study that participated in the challenge.

OBJECTIVES: Prior research has reported an increased risk of fatality for
patients with cancer, but most studies investigated the risk by comparing cancer 
to non-cancer patients among COVID-19 infections, where cancer might have
contributed to the increased risk. This study is to understand COVID-19's imposed
HR of fatality while controlling for covariates, such as age, sex, metastasis
status and cancer type.
METHODS: We conducted survival analyses of 4606 cancer patients with COVID-19
test results from 16 March to 11 October 2020 in UK Biobank and estimated the
overall HR of fatality with and without COVID-19 infection. We also examined the 
HRs of 13 specific cancer types with at least 100 patients using a stratified
analysis.
RESULTS: COVID-19 resulted in an overall HR of 7.76 (95% CI 5.78 to 10.40,
p<10-10) by following 4606 patients with cancer for 21 days after the tests. The 
HR varied among cancer type, with over a 10-fold increase in fatality rate (false
discovery rate ≤0.02) for melanoma, haematological malignancies, uterine cancer
and kidney cancer. Although COVID-19 imposed a higher risk for localised versus
distant metastasis cancers, those of distant metastases yielded higher overall
fatality rates due to their multiplicative effects.
DISCUSSION: The results confirmed prior reports for the increased risk of
fatality for patients with COVID-19 plus hematological malignancies and
demonstrated similar findings of COVID-19 on melanoma, uterine, and kidney
cancers.
CONCLUSION: The results highlight the heightened risk that COVID-19 imposes on
localised and haematological cancer patients and the necessity to vaccinate
uninfected patients with cancer promptly, particularly for the cancer types most

patients with localised cancer, whether they are infected by COVID-19 or not.

BACKGROUND: Governance of controlled drugs (CDs) in hospitals is resource
intensive but important for patient safety and policy compliance.
OBJECTIVES: To explore whether and how storing CDs in an automated dispensing
cabinet (ADC) in a children's hospital intensive care unit (ICU) contributes to
the effectiveness and efficiency of CD governance.
METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods exploratory study, comprising observations,
interviews and audits, 3 months after ADC implementation. We observed 54 hours of
medications activities in the ICU medication room (with 42 hours of timed data); 
interviewed nurses (n=19), management (n=1) and pharmacy staff (n=3); reviewed
6 months of ICU incident reports pertaining to CD governance; audited 6 months of
CD register data and extracted logs of all ADC transactions for the 3 months
following implementation. Data analysis focused on four main CD governance
activities: safekeeping/controlling access, documenting use, monitoring, and
reporting/investigating.
RESULTS: Nurses and pharmacists perceived spending less time on CD governance
tasks with the ADC. The ADC supported CD governance through automated
documentation of CD transactions; 'blind counts'; automated count discrepancy
checks; electronic alerts and reporting functionalities. It changed quality and
distribution of governance tasks, such as removing the requirement for 'nurses
with keys' to access CDs, and allowing pharmacists to generate reports remotely, 
rather than reviewing registers on the ward. For CDs in the ADC, auditing and
monitoring appeared to be ongoing rather than periodic. Such changes appeared to 
create positive reinforcing loops. However, the ADC also created challenges for
CD governance. Most importantly, it was not suitable for all CDs, leading to
workarounds and parallel use of a safe plus paper registers.
CONCLUSIONS: ADCs can significantly alter CDs governance in clinical areas.
Effects of an ADC on efficiency and effectiveness of governance tasks appear to
be complex, going beyond simple time savings or more stringent controls.

BACKGROUND: As a major public health crisis, the novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic demonstrates the urgent need for safe, effective, and
evidence-based implementations of digital health. The urgency stems from the
frequent tendency to focus attention on seemingly high promising digital health
interventions despite being poorly validated in times of crisis.
AIM: In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage
evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and
public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working
groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics
Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this
crisis.
METHODS: Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of
26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based
efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion
toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this
manuscript.
RESULTS: Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing
evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health
solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally 
about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced 
when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for
clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and
research during COVID-19.
DISCUSSION: Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when
designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid
delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a
multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital
health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing 
in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the 
local, national, and international levels. The training and capacity building of 
front-line workers is crucial and must be linked to a clear strategy for
evaluation of ongoing experiences.

Persons with Substance Abuse Disorders and Other Addictions: Coping with the
COVID-19 Pandemic.

Fabelo-Roche JR(1), Iglesias-Moré S(1), Gómez-García AM(1).

(1)Medical University of Havana.

Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which
were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, 
people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be 
tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by
increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean
relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team
of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic
Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these
disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19
social isolation. With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients 
undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a
qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of
37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from
addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19
restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication
technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding
patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured
survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory
approach. We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges
presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for
maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with
therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties
faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties,
disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of
myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed
benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4)
tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness,
anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands). Our findings suggest that
despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social
isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by
these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks
that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges 
to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations,
myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward
irrationality or lack of emotional control.

OBJECTIVES: We describe a hospital's implementation of predictive models to
optimise emergency response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: We were tasked to construct and evaluate COVID-19 driven predictive
models to identify possible planning and resource utilisation scenarios. We used 
system dynamics to derive a series of chain susceptible, infected and recovered
(SIR) models. We then built a discrete event simulation using the system dynamics
output and bootstrapped electronic medical record data to approximate the weekly 
effect of tuning surgical volume on hospital census. We evaluated performance via
a model fit assessment and cross-model comparison.
RESULTS: We outlined the design and implementation of predictive models to
support management decision making around areas impacted by COVID-19. The fit
assessments indicated the models were most useful after 30 days from onset of
local cases. We found our subreports were most accurate up to 7 days after model 
run.DiscusssionOur model allowed us to shape our health system's executive policy
response to implement a 'hospital within a hospital'-one for patients with
COVID-19 within a hospital able to care for the regular non-COVID-19 population. 
The surgical scheduleis modified according to models that predict the number of
new patients withCovid-19 who require admission. This enabled our hospital to
coordinateresources to continue to support the community at large. Challenges
includedthe need to frequently adjust or create new models to meet rapidly
evolvingrequirements, communication, and adoption, and to coordinate the needs
ofmultiple stakeholders. The model we created can be adapted to other health
systems,provide a mechanism to predict local peaks in cases and inform
hospitalleadership regarding bed allocation, surgical volumes, staffing, and
suppliesone for COVID-19 patients within a hospital able to care for the
regularnon-COVID-19 population.
CONCLUSION: Predictive models are essential tools in supporting decision making
when coordinating clinical operations during a pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Smartphones and mobile applications have seen a surge in popularity
in recent years, a pattern that has also been reflected in the health care
system. Despite increased reliance among clinicians however, limited research has
been conducted on the uptake and impact of smartphone usage in medical practice, 
especially outside the Western world.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the usage of smartphones and medical apps
by doctors in the clinical setting in 2 culturally distinct countries: King Hamad
University Hospital (KHUH), Bahrain and Queen Mary Hospital (QMH), Hong Kong.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted where doctors in both
hospitals were asked to take part in a 15-item online survey. The questions were 
categorized into the following groups: demographics of the study population,
ownership and main use of smartphones, number and names of medical apps currently
owned, rating usage of smartphones for medical purposes, time spent on a
smartphone related to clinical use, clinical reliance on smartphones, and views
on further integration of smartphones. The results were then tabulated and
analyzed using SPSS Statistics 25 for Mac (IBM Corp Inc, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS: A total of 200 doctors were surveyed, with a total of 99.0% (99/100) of 
the doctors owning a smartphone in both KHUH and QMH; 58% (57/99) and 55% (54/99)
of the doctors from KHUH and QMH, respectively, identified communication as their
main use of smartphones in the clinical setting (P=.004). Doctors from KHUH were 
likely to spend more time on medical apps than doctors from QMH (P=.002).
According to the overall results of both hospitals, 48% (32/67) of the junior
doctors claimed high reliance on smartphones, whereas only 32.3% (41/127) of the 
senior doctors said the same (P=.03). Of doctors in KHUH and QMH, 78.0% (78/100) 
and 69.0% (69/100), respectively, either strongly agreed or agreed that
smartphones need to be integrated into the clinical setting. In terms of
preferences for future apps, 48% (48/100) and 56% (56/100) of the doctors in KHUH
and QMH, respectively, agreed that more medical applications need to be created
in order to support smartphone use in the clinical setting.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a substantial acceptance of smartphones by
doctors in the clinical setting. It also elicits the need to establish policies
to officially integrate smartphone technology into health care in accordance with
ethical guidelines. More emphasis should be placed on creating medical
applications that aid health care professionals in attaining their information
from accurate sources and also regulate a system to monitor the usage of mobile
devices within hospitals to prevent a breach of patient privacy and
confidentiality.

New York City quickly became an epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. An ability to
triage patients was needed due to a sudden and massive increase in patients
during the COVID-19 pandemic as healthcare providers incurred an exponential
increase in workload,which created a strain on the staff and limited resources.
Further, methods to better understand and characterise the predictors of
morbidity and mortality was needed. METHODS: We developed a prediction model to
predict patients at risk for mortality using only laboratory, vital and
demographic information readily available in the electronic health record on more
than 3395 hospital admissions with COVID-19. Multiple methods were applied, and
final model was selected based on performance. A variable importance algorithm
was used for interpretability, and understanding of performance and predictors
was applied to the best model. We built a model with an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of 83-97 to identify predictors and patients with 
high risk of mortality due to COVID-19. Oximetry, respirations, blood urea
nitrogen, lymphocyte per cent, calcium, troponin and neutrophil percentage were
important features, and key ranges were identified that contributed to a 50%
increase in patients' mortality prediction score. With an increasing negative
predictive value starting 0.90 after the second day of admission suggests we
might be able to more confidently identify likely survivors DISCUSSION: This
study serves as a use case of a machine learning methods with visualisations to
aide clinicians with a better understanding of the model and predictors of
mortality. CONCLUSION: As we continue to understand COVID-19, computer assisted
algorithms might be able to improve the care of patients.

NJ.

The use of visual presentations to accompany talks has become the established
standard in Medical Informatics conferences and has been the sine qua non at AMIA
for many years. The most widely used software tool to prepare these presentations
has been PowerPoint. AMIA has requested that researchers create their
presentations using a standardized template and make them available ahead of time
on the AMIA agenda website, typically as .pptx or .pdf files. In this paper, we
are providing a few observations about uptake by the community, but, more
importantly, we are making tentative steps towards answering questions about the 
quality of the visual presentation files. The paper starts with a review of four 
sets of guidelines for good PowerPoint presentations. It then provides basic
descriptive statistics and structural observations about the 2019 AMIA
presentations available on AMIA's website and concludes with a few
recommendations for the future.

BACKGROUND: About 30 million people in the EU and USA, respectively, suffer from 
a rare disease. Driven by European legislative requirements, national strategies 
for the improvement of care in rare diseases are being developed. To improve
timely and correct diagnosis for patients with rare diseases, the development of 
a registry for undiagnosed patients was recommended by the German National Action
Plan. In this paper we focus on the question on how such a registry for
undiagnosed patients can be built and which information it should contain.
RESULTS: To develop a registry for undiagnosed patients, a software for data
acquisition and storage, an appropriate data set and an applicable
terminology/classification system for the data collected are needed. We have used
the open-source software Open-Source Registry System for Rare Diseases (OSSE) to 
build the registry for undiagnosed patients. Our data set is based on the minimal
data set for rare disease patient registries recommended by the European Rare
Disease Registries Platform. We extended this Common Data Set to also include
symptoms, clinical findings and other diagnoses. In order to ensure findability, 
comparability and statistical analysis, symptoms, clinical findings and diagnoses
have to be encoded. We evaluated three medical ontologies (SNOMED CT, HPO and
LOINC) for their usefulness. With exact matches of 98% of tested medical terms, a
mean number of five deposited synonyms, SNOMED CT seemed to fit our needs best.
HPO and LOINC provided 73% and 31% of exacts matches of clinical terms
respectively. Allowing more generic codes for a defined symptom, with SNOMED CT
99%, with HPO 89% and with LOINC 39% of terms could be encoded.
CONCLUSIONS: With the use of the OSSE software and a data set, which, in addition
to the Common Data Set, focuses on symptoms and clinical findings, a functioning 
and meaningful registry for undiagnosed patients can be implemented. The next
step is the implementation of the registry in centres for rare diseases. With the
help of medical informatics and big data analysis, case similarity analyses could
be realized and aid as a decision-support tool enabling diagnosis of
some undiagnosed patients.

This case report describes an initiative implemented to improve physicians'
experience with Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and is one of several
strategies within our organization developed to reduce physician burnout
attributed to the EHR. The EHR SWAT Team-a 10-member team-with interdisciplinary 
representation from clinical informatics, pharmacy informatics, health
information management, clinical applications, and project management, is a
direct feedback channel for all physicians to express their EHR challenges and
have their requests reviewed, prioritized, and fixed in a timely manner. Through 
in-person divisional meetings, we gathered 118 requests, 36.4% of which were
related to re-education and 17% of which were quick fixes. Popular requests
included keyword search functionality, minimizing freezing, auto-faxing and
auto-save. Our brief evaluation of 46 physicians demonstrated that physicians
were satisfied with the initiative, with 61.3% physicians reporting that it
increased their proficiency in using EHR functionalities. Lessons learned from
this initiative include the importance of buy-in from Information Technology (IT)
and physician leadership, extensive physician engagement, and leveraging project 
management techniques for coordination. Next steps include measuring the impact
of this SWAT initiative on EHR-related burnout through a post-intervention
organizational wide survey and objective back-end usage logs.

OBJECTIVES: To highlight the role of technology assessment in the management of
the COVID-19 pandemic.
METHOD: An overview of existing research and evaluation approaches along with
expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association 
(IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health
Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working
Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems.
RESULTS: Evaluation of digital health technologies for COVID-19 should be based
on their technical maturity as well as the scale of implementation. For mature
technologies like telehealth whose efficacy has been previously demonstrated,
pragmatic, rapid evaluation using the complex systems paradigm which accounts for
multiple sociotechnical factors, might be more suitable to examine their
effectiveness and emerging safety concerns in new settings. New technologies,
particularly those intended for use on a large scale such as digital contract
tracing, will require assessment of their usability as well as performance prior 
to deployment, after which evaluation should shift to using a complex systems
paradigm to examine the value of information provided. The success of a digital
health technology is dependent on the value of information it provides relative
to the sociotechnical context of the setting where it is implemented.
CONCLUSION: Commitment to evaluation using the evidence-based medicine and
complex systems paradigms will be critical to ensuring safe and effective use of 
digital health technologies for COVID-19 and future pandemics. There is an
inherent tension between evaluation and the imperative to urgently deploy
solutions that needs to be negotiated.

OBJECTIVES: The emerging COVID-19 pandemic has caused one of the world's worst
health disasters compounded by social confusion with misinformation, the
so-called "Infodemic". In this paper, we discuss how open technology approaches -
including data sharing, visualization, and tooling - can address the COVID-19
pandemic and infodemic.
METHODS: In response to the call for participation in the 2020 International
Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on Medical
Informatics and the Pandemic, the IMIA Open Source Working Group surveyed recent 
works related to the use of Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for this
pandemic.
RESULTS: FLOSS health care projects including GNU Health, OpenMRS, DHIS2, and
others, have responded from the early phase of this pandemic. Data related to
COVID-19 have been published from health organizations all over the world. Civic 
Technology, and the collaborative work of FLOSS and open data groups were
considered to support collective intelligence on approaches to managing the
pandemic.
CONCLUSION: FLOSS and open data have been effectively used to contribute to
managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and open approaches to collaboration can improve 
trust in data.

OBJECTIVES: Telehealth implementation is a complex systems-based endeavour. This 
paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19
across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of
telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our
overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth
implementation to support critical response.
METHODS: We sought responses from the members of the International Medical
Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices
and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in
their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six
emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of
health systems.
RESULTS: Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or
regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and
delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and
perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to
COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these
themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in
critical response.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in
times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO
systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19
pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides
guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a
global pandemic such as COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: On December 16, 2020 representatives of the International Medical
Informatics Association (IMIA), a Non-Governmental Organization in official
relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), along with its International 
Academy for Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI), held an open dialogue with WHO
Director General (WHO DG) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus about the opportunities and 
challenges of digital health during the COVID-19 global pandemic.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this paper is to report the outcomes of the dialogue and
discussions with more than 200 participants representing different civil society 
organizations (CSOs).
METHODS: The dialogue was held in form of a webinar. After an initial address of 
the WHO DG, short presentations by the panelists, and live discussions between
panelists, the WHO DG and WHO representatives took place. The audience was able
to post questions in written. These written discussions were saved with
participants' consent and summarized in this paper.
RESULTS: The main themes that were brought up by the audience for discussion
were: (a) opportunities and challenges in general; (b) ethics and artificial
intelligence; (c) digital divide; (d) education. Proposed actions included the
development of a roadmap based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision making by policy makers needs to be evidence-based and
health informatics research should be used to support decisions surrounding
digital health, and we further propose next steps in the collaboration between
IMIA and WHO such as future engagement in the World Health Assembly.

Pandemics: Historically Slow "Learning Curve" Leading to Biomedical Informatics
and Vaccine Breakthroughs.

Kulikowski CA(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, USA.

BACKGROUND: The worldwide tragedy of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic vividly demonstrates just how inadequate
mitigation and control of the spread of infectious diseases can be when faced
with a new microorganism with unknown pathogenic effects. Responses by
governments in charge of public health, and all other involved organizations,
have proved largely wanting. Data infrastructure and the information and
communication systems needed to deal with the pandemic have likewise not been up 
to the task. Nevertheless, after a year of the worldwide outbreak, hope arises
from this being the first major pandemic event in history where genomic and
related biosciences - relying on biomedical informatics - have been essential in 
decoding the viral sequence data and producing the mRNA and other biotechnologies
that unexpectedly rapidly have led to investigation, design, development, and
testing of useful vaccines. Medical informatics may also help support public
health actions and clinical interventions - but scalability and impact will
depend on overcoming ingrained human shortcomings to deal with complex
socio-economic, political, and technological disruptions together with the many
ethical challenges presented by pandemics.
OBJECTIVES: The principal goal is to review the history of biomedical information
and healthcare practices related to past pandemics in order to illustrate just
how exceptional and dependent on biomedical informatics are the recent scientific
insights into human immune responses to viral infection, which are enabling rapid
antiviral vaccine development and clinical management of severe cases - despite
the many societal challenges ahead.
METHODS: This paper briefly reviews some of the key historical antecedents
leading up to modern insights into epidemic and pandemic processes with their
biomedical and healthcare information intended to guide practitioners, agencies, 
and the lay public in today's ongoing pandemic events.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor scientific understanding and excessively slow learning about
infectious disease processes and mitigating behaviors have stymied effective
treatment until the present time. Advances in insights about immune systems,
genomes, proteomes, and all the other -omes, became a reality thanks to the key
sequencing technologies and biomedical informatics that enabled the Human Genome 
Project, and only now, 20 years later, are having an impact in ameliorating
devastating zoonotic infectious pandemics, including the present SARS-CoV-2 event
through unprecedently rapid vaccine development. In the future these advances
will hopefully also enable more targeted prevention and treatment of disease.
However, past and present shortcomings of most of the COVID-19 pandemic responses
illustrate just how difficult it is to persuade enough people - and especially
political leaders - to adopt societally beneficial risk-avoidance behaviors and
policies, even as these become better understood.

OBJECTIVES: The European University Association (EUA) defines "employability" as 
a major goal of higher education. Therefore, competence-based orientation is an
important aspect of education. The representation of a standardized job profile
in the field of medical informatics, which is based on the most common labor
market requirements, is fundamental for identifying and conveying the learning
goals corresponding to these competences.
METHODS: To identify the most common requirements, we extracted 544 job
advertisements from the German job portal, STEPSTONE. This process was conducted 
via a program we developed in R with the "rvest" library, utilizing web crawling,
web extraction, and text mining. After removing duplicates and filtering for jobs
that required a bachelor's degree, 147 job advertisements remained, from which we
extracted qualification terms. We categorized the terms into six groups:
professional expertise, soft skills, teamwork, processes, learning, and
problem-solving abilities.
RESULTS: The results showed that only 45% of the terms are related to
professional expertise, while 55% are related to soft skills. Studies of employee
soft skills have shown similar results. The most prevalent terms were
programming, experience, project, and server. Our second major finding is the
importance of experience, further underlining how essential practical skills are.
CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies used surveys and narrative descriptions. This is
the first study to use web crawling, web extraction, and text mining. Our
research shows that soft skills and specialist knowledge carry equal weight. The 
insights gained from this study may be of assistance in developing curricula for 
medical informatics.

OBJECTIVE: To examine how and to what extent medical devices using machine
learning (ML) support clinician decision making.
METHODS: We searched for medical devices that were (1) approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) up till February 2020; (2) intended for use by
clinicians; (3) in clinical tasks or decisions and (4) used ML. Descriptive
information about the clinical task, device task, device input and output, and ML
method were extracted. The stage of human information processing automated by
ML-based devices and level of autonomy were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 137 candidates, 59 FDA approvals for 49 unique devices were included.
Most approvals (n=51) were since 2018. Devices commonly assisted with diagnostic 
(n=35) and triage (n=10) tasks. Twenty-three devices were assistive, providing
decision support but left clinicians to make important decisions including
diagnosis. Twelve automated the provision of information (autonomous
information), such as quantification of heart ejection fraction, while 14
automatically provided task decisions like triaging the reading of scans
according to suspected findings of stroke (autonomous decisions). Stages of human
information processing most automated by devices were information analysis,
(n=14) providing information as an input into clinician decision making, and
decision selection (n=29), where devices provide a decision.
CONCLUSION: Leveraging the benefits of ML algorithms to support clinicians while 
mitigating risks, requires a solid relationship between clinician and ML-based
devices. Such relationships must be carefully designed, considering how
algorithms are embedded in devices, the tasks supported, information provided and
clinicians' interactions with them.

BACKGROUND: Artificial pancreas is a well-known research topic devoted to
achieving better glycemic outcomes that has been attracting increasing attention 
over the years. However, there is a lack of systematic, chronological, and
synthesizing studies that show the background of the knowledge generation in this
field. This study implements a bibliometric analysis to recognize the main
documents, type of publications, research categories, countries, keywords,
organizations, and authors related to this topic.
METHODS: Web of Science core collection database was accessed from 2000 to 2020
in order to select high-quality scientific documents based on a specific search
query. Bibexcel, MS Excel, Power BI, R-Studio, VOSviewer, and CorText software
were used for a descriptive and network analysis based on the local database
obtained. Bibliometric parameters as the h-index, frequencies, co-authorship and 
co-ocurrences were computed.
RESULTS: A total of 756 documents were included that show a growing scientific
production on this topic with an increasing contribution from engineering.
Outstanding authors, organizations, and countries were identified. An analysis of
trends in research was conducted according to the scientific categories of the
Web of Science database to identify the main research interests of the last 2
decades and the emerging areas with greater prominence in the coming years. A
keyword network analysis allowed to identify the main stages in the development
of the AP research over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Results reveal a comprehensive background of the knowledge
generation for the AP topic during the last 2 decades, which has been
strengthened with international collaborations and a remarkable
interdisciplinarity between endocrinology and engineering, giving rise to a
growing number of research areas over time, where computer science and medical
informatics stand out as the main emerging research areas.

OBJECTIVES: Quantum noise is a random process in X-ray-based imaging systems. We 
addressed and measured the uncertainty of radiomics features against this quantum
noise in computed tomography (CT) images.
METHODS: A clinical multi-detector CT scanner, two homogeneous phantom sets, and 
four heterogeneous samples were used. A solid tumor tissue removed from a male
BALB/c mouse was included. We the placed phantom sets on the CT scanning table
and repeated 20 acquisitions with identical imaging settings. Regions of interest
were delineated for feature extraction. Statistical quantities-average, standard 
deviation, and percentage uncertainty-were calculated from these 20 repeated
scans. Percentage uncertainty was used to measure and quantify feature stability 
against quantum noise. Twelve radiomics features were measured. Random noise was 
added to study the robustness of machine learning classifiers against feature
uncertainty.
RESULTS: We found the ranges of percentage uncertainties from homogeneous soft
tissue phantoms, homogeneous bone phantoms, and solid tumor tissue to be
0.01-2138%, 0.02-15%, and 0.18-16%, respectively. Overall, it was found that the 
CT features ShortRunHighGrayLevelEmpha (SRHGE) (0.01-0.18%),
ShortRunLowGrayLevelEmpha (SRLGE) (0.01-0.41%), LowGrayLevelRunEmpha (LGRE)
(0.01-0.39%), and LongRunLowGrayLevelEmpha (LRLGE) (0.02-0.66%) were the most
stable features against the inherent quantum noise. The most unstable features
were cluster shade (1-2138%) and max probability (1-16%). The impact of random
noise to the prediction accuracy by different machine learning classifiers was
found to be between 0 and 12%.
CONCLUSIONS: Twelve features were used for uncertainty measurements. The upper
and lower bounds of percentage uncertainties were determined. The quantum noise
effect on machine learning classifiers is model dependent.
KEY POINTS: • Quantum noise is a random process and is intrinsic to X-ray-based
imaging systems. This inherent quantum noise creates unpredictable fluctuations
in the gray-level intensities of image pixels. Extra cautions and further
validations are strongly recommended when unstable radiomics features are
selected by a predictive model for disease classification or treatment outcome
prognosis. • We addressed and used the statistical quantity of percentage
uncertainty to measure the uncertainty of radiomics features against the inherent
quantum noise in computed tomography (CT) images. • A clinical multi-detector CT 
scanner, two homogeneous phantom sets, and four heterogeneous samples were used
in the stability measurement. A solid tumor tissue removed from a male BALB/c
mouse was included in the heterogeneous sample.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) are a central feature of care
delivery in acute care hospitals; however, the financial and quality outcomes
associated with system performance remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between the top 3 
EHR vendors and measures of hospital financial and quality performance.
METHODS: This study evaluated 2667 hospitals with Cerner, Epic, or Meditech as
their primary EHR and considered their performance with regard to net income,
Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Total Performance Score (TPS), and the unweighted
subdomains of efficiency and cost reduction; clinical care; patient- and
caregiver-centered experience; and patient safety. We hypothesized that there
would be a difference among the 3 vendors for each measure.
RESULTS: None of the EHR systems were associated with a statistically significant
financial relationship in our study. Epic was positively associated with TPS
outcomes (R2=23.6%; β=.0159, SE 0.0079; P=.04) and higher patient perceptions of 
quality (R2=29.3%; β=.0292, SE 0.0099; P=.003) but was negatively associated with
patient safety quality scores (R2=24.3%; β=-.0221, SE 0.0102; P=.03). Cerner and 
Epic were positively associated with improved efficiency (R2=31.9%; Cerner:
β=.0330, SE 0.0135, P=.01; Epic: β=.0465, SE 0.0133, P<.001). Finally, all 3
vendors were associated with positive performance in the clinical care domain
(Epic: β=.0388, SE 0.0122, P=.002; Cerner: β=.0283, SE 0.0124, P=.02; Meditech:
β=.0273, SE 0.0123, P=.03) but with low explanatory power (R2=4.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide evidence of a difference in
clinical outcome performance among the top 3 EHR vendors and may serve as
supportive evidence for health care leaders to target future capital investments 
to improve health care delivery.

BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic disease that causes
chronic lung infections. We developed an internet-based decision aid (DA) to help
patients with CF make better informed decisions regarding treatments and advance 
care planning. We built the DA around two major treatment decisions: whether to
have a lung transplant and whether to agree to invasive mechanical ventilation
(intubation).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct usability testing of the InformedChoices CF
DA among key stakeholder groups.
METHODS: We performed a patient needs assessment using think-aloud usability
testing with patients with CF, their surrogates, and CF clinicians. Think-aloud
participants provided feedback while navigating the DA, and after viewing, they
answered surveys. Transcripts from the think-aloud sessions and survey results
were categorized into common, generalizable themes and optimizations for
improving content, comprehension, and navigation. We assessed the ease of use of 
the DA (System Usability Scale) and also assessed the participants' perceptions
regarding the overall tone, with an emphasis on emotional reactions to the DA
content, level of detail, and usefulness of the information for making decisions 
about either intubation or lung transplantation, including how well they
understood the information and were able to apply it to their own decision-making
process. We also assessed the DA's ease of navigation, esthetics, and whether
participants were able to complete a series of usability tasks (eg, locating
specific information in the DA or using the interactive survival estimates
calculator) to ensure that the website was easy to navigate during the
clinic-based advance care planning discussions.
RESULTS: A total of 12 participants from 3 sites were enrolled from March 9 to
August 30, 2018, for the usability testing: 5 CF clinicians (mean age 48.2, SD
12.0 years), 5 adults with CF, and 2 family and surrogate caregivers of people
with CF (mean age of CF adults and family and surrogate caregivers 38.8, SD 10.8 
years). Among the 12 participants, the average System Usability Scale score for
the DA was 88.33 (excellent). Think-aloud analysis identified 3 themes:
functionality, visibility and navigation, and content and usefulness. Areas for
improvement included reducing repetition, enhancing comprehension, and changing
the flow. Several changes to improve the content and usefulness of the DA were
recommended, including adding information about alternatives to childbearing,
such as adoption and surrogacy. On the basis of survey responses, we found that
the navigation of the site was easy for clinicians, patients, and surrogates who 
participated in usability testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Usability testing revealed areas of potential improvement. Testing
also yielded positive feedback, suggesting the DA's future success. Integrating
changes before implementation should improve the DA's comprehension, navigation, 
and usefulness and lead to greater adoption.

INTRODUCTION: Health Data Research UK designated seven UK-based Hubs to
facilitate health data use for research. PIONEER is the Hub in Acute Care.
PIONEER delivered workshops where patients/public citizens agreed key principles 
to guide access to unconsented, anonymised, routinely collected health data.
These were used to inform the protocol.
METHODS: This paper describes the PIONEER infrastructure and data access
processes. PIONEER is a research database and analytical environment that links
routinely collected health data across community, ambulance and hospital
healthcare providers. PIONEER aims ultimately to improve patient health and care,
by making health data discoverable and accessible for research by National Health
Service, academic and commercial organisations. The PIONEER protocol incorporates
principles identified in the public/patient workshops. This includes all data
access requests being reviewed by the Data Trust Committee, a group of public
citizens who advise on whether requests should be supported prior to licensed
access.

OBJECTIVE: Major issues in imaging data management of tumor response assessment
in clinical trials include high human errors in data input and unstandardized
data structures, warranting a new breakthrough IT solution. Thus, we aim to
develop a Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)-compliant
clinical trial imaging management system (CTIMS) with automatic verification and 
transformation modules for implementing the CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model
(SDTM) in the tumor response assessment dataset of clinical trials.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In accordance with various CDISC standards guides and
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines, the overall
system architecture of CDISC-compliant CTIMS was designed. Modules for
standard-compliant electronic case report form (eCRF) to verify data conformance 
and transform into SDTM data format were developed by experts in diverse fields
such as medical informatics, medical, and clinical trial. External validation of 
the CDISC-compliant CTIMS was performed by comparing it with our previous CTIMS
based on real-world data and CDISC validation rules by Pinnacle 21 Community
Software.
RESULTS: The architecture of CDISC-compliant CTIMS included the
standard-compliant eCRF module of RECIST, the automatic verification module of
the input data, and the SDTM transformation module from the eCRF input data to
the SDTM datasets based on CDISC Define-XML. This new system was incorporated
into our previous CTIMS. External validation demonstrated that all 176 human
input errors occurred in the previous CTIMS filtered by a new system yielding
zero error and CDISC-compliant dataset. The verified eCRF input data were
automatically transformed into the SDTM dataset, which satisfied the CDISC
validation rules by Pinnacle 21 Community Software.
CONCLUSIONS: To assure data consistency and high quality of the tumor response
assessment data, our new CTIMS can minimize human input error by using
standard-compliant eCRF with an automatic verification module and automatically
transform the datasets into CDISC SDTM format.

Voice-Controlled Intelligent Personal Assistants in Health Care: International
Delphi Study.

Germany.

BACKGROUND: Voice-controlled intelligent personal assistants (VIPAs), such as
Amazon Echo and Google Home, involve artificial intelligence-powered algorithms
designed to simulate humans. Their hands-free interface and growing capabilities 
have a wide range of applications in health care, covering off-clinic education, 
health monitoring, and communication. However, conflicting factors, such as
patient safety and privacy concerns, make it difficult to foresee the further
development of VIPAs in health care.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a plausible scenario for the further
development of VIPAs in health care to support decision making regarding the
procurement of VIPAs in health care organizations.
METHODS: We conducted a two-stage Delphi study with an internationally recruited 
panel consisting of voice assistant experts, medical professionals, and
representatives of academia, governmental health authorities, and nonprofit
health associations having expertise with voice technology. Twenty projections
were formulated and evaluated by the panelists. Descriptive statistics were used 
to derive the desired scenario.
RESULTS: The panelists expect VIPAs to be able to provide solid medical advice
based on patients' personal health information and to have human-like
conversations. However, in the short term, voice assistants might neither provide
frustration-free user experience nor outperform or replace humans in health care.
With a high level of consensus, the experts agreed with the potential of VIPAs to
support elderly people and be widely used as anamnesis, informational,
self-therapy, and communication tools by patients and health care professionals. 
Although users' and governments' privacy concerns are not expected to decrease in
the near future, the panelists believe that strict regulations capable of
preventing VIPAs from providing medical help services will not be imposed.
CONCLUSIONS: According to the surveyed experts, VIPAs will show notable
technological development and gain more user trust in the near future, resulting 
in widespread application in health care. However, voice assistants are expected 
to solely support health care professionals in their daily operations and will
not be able to outperform or replace medical staff.

During Switzerland's first wave of COVID-19, clinical pharmacy activities during 
medical rounds in Geneva University Hospitals were replaced by targeted remote
interventions. We describe using the electronic PharmaCheck system to screen
high-risk situations of adverse drug events (ADEs), particularly targeting
prescriptions of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPVr) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the
presence of contraindications or prescriptions outside institutional guidelines. 
Of 416 patients receiving LPVr and/or HCQ, 182 alerts were triggered for 164
(39.4%) patients. The main associated risk factors of ADEs were drug-drug
interactions, QTc interval prolongation, electrolyte disorder and inadequate LPVr
dosage. Therapeutic optimisation recommended by a pharmacist or proposals for
additional monitoring were accepted in 80% (n=36) of cases. Combined with
pharmacist contextualisation to the clinical context, PharmaCheck made it
possible to successfully adapt clinical pharmacist activities by switching from a
global to a targeted analysis mode in an emergency context.

BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Medical schools have evolved toward competency-based
education and active learner-centered strategies. Medical informatics course was 
introduced in 2011 in the 3rd year at the College of Medicine (CoM), King Saud
University (KSU), to enhance future medical graduates with technological and
information competencies. Modified team-based learning and blended learning were 
emphasized using face-to-face lectures, various e-learning technologies, workshop
and seminars. The current study's main objective was to assess students'
perceptions towards blended and modified team-based learning at the CoM in KSU.
METHODS: A survey was distributed to medical students in three consecutive years:
2017-2019. The survey contains items regarding student perception of various
types of blended learning techniques applied in the course. The survey was
administered using i-Clicker; an interactive device that enables students to
answer survey questions. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the
perception of students on these blended learning dimensions investigated.
RESULTS: Seven-hundred and one student responded to the questionnaire (male;
69.5%, female 30.5%). Out of which, 59.1% of students found team interactions
positively supported discussions and asked questions freely, and 48.1% expressed 
that working in groups facilitated their learning process. However, 56.0% of
students chose face-to-face lectures as the most preferred class activities
followed by discussion 23.8%. More than 78% of participants agree that online
quizzes are good experience and enjoyable. Grade center where students can check 
for marks and attendance also received high perception (66.3%).
CONCLUSION: Introducing modified team-based and blended-learning are considered
challenging, and therefore, investigating their perceptions can provide useful
insights into how these methods could be used more effectively. The
blended-learning technique is highly essential in teaching medical informatics to
overcome challenges faced due to a large number of students and the need for
various exposures to reach the course's learning goals. Moreover, it is noticed
that students were engaged in face-to-face and online activities, furthermore,
modified team-based learning reported facilitating learning and asking questions 
without embarrassment.

    Obstet Gynecol. 2021 May 1;137(5):761-762.

OBJECTIVE: To use a data-fusion approach to improve ascertainment of maternal
deaths not detected with standard surveillance strategies.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study from the electronic health
records of a tertiary medical center from 2011 to 2018. Cases of maternal death
were identified in two ways: 1) using a standard medical informatics service
query of hospital data and 2) using the TriNetX discovery tool as patients with a
vital status of "deceased" and evidence of antecedent pregnancy exposure based on
such factors as obstetric diagnostic codes or obstetric-related procedures.
Potential cases of maternal death identified by the latter method underwent chart
review to confirm timing of death compared with timing of last appreciable
pregnancy, and to characterize the details of these deaths. The primary outcome
was pregnancy-associated mortality during pregnancy or within the first
postpartum year in the discovery cohort compared with the hospital-identified
cohort. Secondary outcomes included causes of death and comorbidities.
RESULTS: During the study period, the standard service query identified 23
maternal deaths. The discovery tool identified 18 additional patients confirmed
on subsequent chart review to represent pregnancy-associated deaths, a 78%
increase in ascertainment of which a greater proportion represented postpartum
deaths. The majority (61%) of newly ascertained mortalities were related to
cardiac causes or other medical comorbidities. Although many hospital-ascertained
cases were associated with deaths after delivery of a living newborn, more deaths
after early pregnancy loss or termination were identified through the discovery
tool.
CONCLUSION: Improved recognition of pregnancy-associated deaths can be achieved
with modern data analytics.

OBJECTIVES: The UK MitraClip registry was commissioned by National Health Service
(NHS) England to assess real-world outcomes from percutaneous mitral valve repair
for mitral regurgitation using a new technology, MitraClip. This study aimed to
determine longitudinal patient outcomes by linking to routine datasets: Hospital 
Episode Statistics (HES) Admitted Patient Care (APC) and Office of National
Statistics.
METHODS: Two methods of linkage were compared, using identifiable (NHS number,
date of birth, postcode, gender) and non-identifiable data (hospital trust, age
in years, admission, discharge and operation dates, operation and diagnosis
codes). Outcome measures included: matching success, patient demographics,
all-cause mortality and subsequent cardiac intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 197 registry patients were eligible for matching with routine
administrative data. Using identifiable linkage, a total of 187 patients (94.9%) 
were matched with the HES APC dataset. However, 21 matched individuals (11.2%)
had inconsistencies across the datasets (eg, different gender) and were
subsequently removed, leaving 166 (84.3%) for analysis. Using non-identifiable
data linkage, a total of 170 patients (86.3%) were uniquely matched with the HES 
APC dataset.Baseline patient characteristics were not significantly different
between the two methods of data linkage. The total number of deaths (all causes) 
identified from identifiable and non-identifiable linkage methods was 37 and 40, 
respectively, and the difference in subsequent cardiac interventions identified
between the two methods was negligible.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients from a bespoke clinical procedural registry were matched to
routine administrative data using identifiable and non-identifiable methods with 
equivalent matching success rates, similar baseline characteristics and similar
2-year outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: The historical separation between medicine and dentistry has
resulted in the creation of separate health records, which have the potential to 
negatively impact patient care and safety. Of particular importance, errors or
omissions in medication lists in separate electronic health records (EHRs) may
lead to medical errors and serious adverse outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare medication lists reported in the EHRs of
active patients treated by both the University of Michigan School of Dentistry
and Michigan Medicine to determine if differences exist.
METHODS: In this cohort study, EHRs of a population of 159,733 patients that the 
University of Michigan medical and dental clinics share in common were
investigated for agreement in the reporting of 16 medications. After exclusion of
minors and patients not seen in the last 5 y, records of 27,277 patients were
examined.
RESULTS: The maximum percentage of agreement in medications reported in both
records was 52% for levothyroxine, and the minimum was 7% for sildenafil. The
medical record had a significantly higher number of unique medications than the
dental record, suggesting higher underreporting in the dental setting.
CONCLUSION: The lack of agreement in the report of medications with serious
dental and medical implications argues in favor of unification of records and use
of available technology to increase accurate medication reporting.
KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results demonstrate a lack of agreement between
medications reported in medical and dental records, which can have serious
implications to patients' health. A unified health record, employing available
technology to increase accurate medication reporting, would mitigate this
problem.

Linking clinical narratives to standardized vocabularies and coding systems is a 
key component of unlocking the information in medical text for analysis. However,
many domains of medical concepts, such as functional outcomes and social
determinants of health, lack well-developed terminologies that can support
effective coding of medical text. We present a framework for developing natural
language processing (NLP) technologies for automated coding of medical
information in under-studied domains, and demonstrate its applicability through a
case study on physical mobility function. Mobility function is a component of
many health measures, from post-acute care and surgical outcomes to chronic
frailty and disability, and is represented as one domain of human activity in the
International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).
However, mobility and other types of functional activity remain under-studied in 
the medical informatics literature, and neither the ICF nor commonly-used medical
terminologies capture functional status terminology in practice. We investigated 
two data-driven paradigms, classification and candidate selection, to link
narrative observations of mobility status to standardized ICF codes, using a
dataset of clinical narratives from physical therapy encounters. Recent advances 
in language modeling and word embedding were used as features for established
machine learning models and a novel deep learning approach, achieving a
macro-averaged F-1 score of 84% on linking mobility activity reports to ICF
codes. Both classification and candidate selection approaches present distinct
strengths for automated coding in under-studied domains, and we highlight that
the combination of (i) a small annotated data set; (ii) expert definitions of
codes of interest; and (iii) a representative text corpus is sufficient to
produce high-performing automated coding systems. This research has implications 
for continued development of language technologies to analyze functional status
information, and the ongoing growth of NLP tools for a variety of specialized
applications in clinical care and research.

ABSTRACT: Clinical information systems (CISs) that do not consider usability and 
safety could lead to harmful events. Therefore, we aimed to develop a safety and 
usability guideline of CISs that is comprehensive for both users and developers. 
And the guideline was categorized to apply actual clinical workflow and work
environment.The guideline components were extracted through a systematic review
of the articles published between 2000 and 2015, and existing CIS safety and/or
usability design guidelines. The guideline components were categorized according 
to clinical workflow and types of user interface (UI). The contents of the
guideline were evaluated and validated by experts with 3 specialties: medical
informatics, patient safety, and human engineering.Total 1276 guideline
components were extracted through article and guideline review. Of these, 464
guideline components were categorized according to 5 divisions of the clinical
workflow: "Data identification and selection," "Document entry," "Order entry,"
"Clinical decision support and alert," and "Management". While 521 guideline
components were categorized according to 4 divisions of UI: UIs related to
information process steps, "Perception," "Recognition," "Control," and
"Feedback". We developed a guideline draft with 219 detailed guidance for
clinical task and 70 for UI. Overall appropriateness and comprehensiveness were
proven to achieve more than 90% in experts' survey. However, there were
significant differences among the groups of specialties in the judgment of
appropriateness (P < .001) and comprehensiveness (P = .038).We developed and
verified a safety and usability guideline for CIS that qualifies the requirements
of both clinical workflows and usability issues. The developed guideline can be a
practical tool to enhance the usability and safety of CISs. Further validation is
required by applying the guideline for designing the actual CIS.

OBJECTIVES: Epilepsy surgery is underutilized. Automating the identification of
potential surgical candidates may facilitate earlier intervention. Our objective 
was to develop site-specific machine learning (ML) algorithms to identify
candidates before they undergo surgery.
MATERIALS & METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal cohort
study, ML algorithms were trained on n-grams extracted from free-text neurology
notes, EEG and MRI reports, visit codes, medications, procedures, laboratories,
and demographic information. Site-specific algorithms were developed at two
epilepsy centers: one pediatric and one adult. Cases were defined as patients who
underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and controls were patients with epilepsy
with no history of surgery. The output of the ML algorithms was the estimated
likelihood of candidacy for resective epilepsy surgery. Model performance was
assessed using 10-fold cross-validation.
RESULTS: There were 5880 children (n = 137 had surgery [2.3%]) and 7604 adults
with epilepsy (n = 56 had surgery [0.7%]) included in the study. Pediatric
surgical patients could be identified 2.0 years (range: 0-8.6 years) before
beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) and
PR-AUC =0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.18). Adult surgical patients could be identified
1.0 year (range: 0-5.4 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with 
AUC =0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.93) and PR-AUC =0.31 (95% CI: 0.14-0.48). By the time
patients began their presurgical evaluation, the ML algorithms identified
pediatric and adult surgical patients with AUC =0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The 
mean squared error of the predicted probability of surgical candidacy (Brier
scores) was 0.018 in pediatrics and 0.006 in adults.
CONCLUSIONS: Site-specific machine learning algorithms can identify candidates
for epilepsy surgery early in the disease course in diverse practice settings.

Aging adults depend on complex treatment plans to manage chronic conditions, yet 
little is known about their ability to perform the sophisticated behaviors
required of technologically engaged patients. This qualitative descriptive study 
describes engagement with the plan of care. Forty chronically ill adults
participated in this study, which involved an observation of the clinical
encounter and an interview. Data were collected and analyzed simultaneously in
keeping with principles of qualitative research. Multiple techniques were used to
test conclusions and findings were constructed as thematic sentences, including
the following: I act in ways that support my health, I manage my health-related
information, I make visits with my doctor part of my routine, I participate in
treatment planning. Older adults work to achieve self-management to the best of
their ability, shunning the use of health information technology (HIT) and
demonstrating a preference for provider-created treatment plans.

AIM: To characterize the patterns of care of children with cerebral palsy (CP) in
a tertiary healthcare system.
METHOD: Electronic health record data from 2009 to 2019 were extracted for
children with CP. Machine learning hierarchical clustering was used to identify
clusters of care. The ratio of in-person to care coordination visits was
calculated for each specialty.
RESULTS: The sample included 6369 children with CP (55.7% males, 44.3% females,
76.2% white, 94.7% non-Hispanic; with a mean age of 8y 2mo [SD 5y 10mo; range
0-21y; median 7y 1mo]) at the time of diagnosis. A total of 3.7 million in-person
visits and care coordination notes were identified across 34 specialties. The
duration of care averaged 5 years 5 months with five specialty interactions and
21.8 in-person visits per year per child. Seven clusters of care were identified,
including: musculoskeletal and function; neurological; high-frequency/urgent care
services; procedures; comorbid diagnoses; development and behavioral; and primary
care. Network analysis showed shared membership among several clusters.
INTERPRETATION: Coordination of care is a central element for children with CP.
Medical informatics, machine learning, and big data approaches provide unique
insights into care delivery to inform approaches to improve outcomes for children
with CP. What this paper adds Seven primary clusters of care were identified:
musculoskeletal and function; neurological; high-frequency/urgent care services; 
procedures; comorbid diagnoses; development and behavioral; and primary care. The
in-person to care coordination visit ratio was 1:5 overall for healthcare
encounters. Most interactions with care teams occur outside of in-person visits. 
The ratio of in-person to care coordination activities differ by specialty.

Using information theory to optimize a diagnostic threshold to match
physician-ordering practice.

OBJECTIVE: Clinicians order laboratory tests in an effort to reduce diagnostic or
therapeutic uncertainty. Information theory provides the opportunity to quantify 
the degree to which a test result is expected to reduce diagnostic uncertainty.
We sought to apply information theory toward the evaluation and optimization of a
diagnostic test threshold and to determine if the results would differ from those
of conventional methodologies. We used a heparin/PF4 immunoassay (PF4 ELISA) as a
case study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The laboratory database was queried for PF4 ELISA and
serotonin release assay (SRA) results during the study period, with the latter
serving as the gold standard for the disease heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
(HIT). The optimized diagnostic threshold of the PF4 ELISA test was compared
using conventional versus information theoretic approaches under idealized
(pretest probability = 50%) and realistic (pretest probability = 2.4%) testing
conditions.
RESULTS: Under ideal testing conditions, both analyses yielded a similar
optimized optical density (OD) threshold of OD > 0.79. Under realistic testing
conditions, information theory suggested a higher threshold, OD > 1.5 versus
OD > 0.6. Increasing the diagnostic threshold improved the global information
value, the value of a positive test and the noise content with only a minute
change in the negative test value.
DISCUSSION: Our information theoretic approach suggested that the current FDA
approved cutoff (OD > 0.4) is overly permissive leading to loss of test value and
injection of noise into an already complex diagnostic dilemma. Because our
approach is purely statistical and takes as input data that are readily
accessible in the clinical laboratory it offers a scalable and data-driven
strategy for optimizing test value that may be widely applicable in the domain of
laboratory medicine.
CONCLUSION: Information theory provides more meaningful measures of test value
than the widely used accuracy-based metrics.

Coronavirus disease 2019, first reported in China in late 2019, has quickly
spread across the world. The outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization on March 11, 2020. Here, we describe our initial efforts at the
University of Florida Health for processing of large numbers of tests,
streamlining data collection, and reporting data for optimizing testing
capabilities and superior clinical management. Specifically, we discuss clinical 
and pathology informatics workflows and informatics instruments which we designed
to meet the unique challenges of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) testing. We hope these results benefit institutions preparing to
implement SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Objectives: We develop a dashboard that leverages electronic health record (EHR) 
data to monitor intensive care unit patient status and ventilator utilization in 
the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Materials and methods: Data visualization software is used to display information
from critical care data mart that extracts information from the EHR. A
multidisciplinary collaborative led the development.
Results: The dashboard displays institution-level ventilator utilization details,
as well as patient-level details such as ventilator settings, organ-system
specific parameters, laboratory values, and infusions.
Discussion: Components of the dashboard were selected to facilitate the
determination of resources and simultaneous assessment of multiple patients.
Abnormal values are color coded. An overall illness assessment score is tracked
daily to capture illness severity over time.
Conclusion: This reference guide shares the architecture and sample reusable code
to implement a robust, flexible, and scalable dashboard for monitoring ventilator
utilization and illness severity in intensive care unit ventilated patients.

Who is afraid of black box algorithms? On the epistemological and ethical basis
of trust in medical AI.

The use of black box algorithms in medicine has raised scholarly concerns due to 
their opaqueness and lack of trustworthiness. Concerns about potential bias,
accountability and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust
transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect epistemic concerns
with normative issues. In this paper, we outline that black box algorithms are
less problematic for epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By
outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always necessary, and by
explaining that computational processes are indeed methodologically opaque to
humans, we argue that the reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting
the outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we explain how
computational reliabilism, which does not require transparency and supports the
reliability of algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI are to
be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns remain with black box
algorithms, even when the results are trustworthy. Having justified knowledge
from reliable indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for
normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that deliberation about the 
results of reliable algorithms is required to find out what is a desirable
action. Thus understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss the use
of black box algorithms altogether but should inform the way in which these
algorithms are designed and implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire
the necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical informatics and 
data scientists, black box algorithms can contribute to improving medical care.

BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine has been regarded as a prerequisite for
ensuring health care quality. The increase in health care professionals' adoption
of web-based medical information and the lack of awareness of alternative access 
to evidence-based online resources suggest the need for an investigation of their
information-searching behaviors of using evidence-based online medical databases.
OBJECTIVE: The main purposes of this study were to (1) modify and validate the
internet-specific epistemic beliefs in medicine (ISEBM) questionnaire and (2)
explore the associations between health care professionals' demographics, ISEBM, 
and intention to use evidence-based online medical databases for clinical
practice.
METHODS: Health care professionals in a university-affiliated teaching hospital
were surveyed using the ISEBM questionnaire. The partial least squares-structural
equation modeling was conducted to analyze the reliability and validity of ISEBM.
Furthermore, the structural model was analyzed to examine the possible linkages
between health professionals' demographics, ISEBM, and intention to utilize the
evidence-based online medical databases for clinical practice.
RESULTS: A total of 273 health care professionals with clinical working
experience were surveyed. The results of the measurement model analysis indicated
that all items had significant loadings ranging from 0.71 to 0.92 with
satisfactory composite reliability values ranging from 0.87 to 0.94 and average
variance explained values ranging from 0.70 to 0.84. The results of the
structural relationship analysis revealed that the source of internet-based
medical knowledge (path coefficient -0.26, P=.01) and justification of
internet-based knowing in medicine (path coefficient 0.21, P=.001) were
correlated with the intention to use evidence-based online medical databases.
However, certainty and simplicity of internet-based medical knowledge were not.
In addition, gender (path coefficient 0.12, P=.04) and academic degree (path
coefficient 0.15, P=.004) were associated with intention to use evidence-based
online medical databases for clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: Advancing health care professionals' ISEBM regarding source and
justification may encourage them to retrieve valid medical information through
evidence-based medical databases. Moreover, providing support for specific health
care professionals (ie, females, without a master's degree) may promote their
intention to use certain databases for clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to develop an in-depth understanding of how hospitals
with a long history of health information technology (HIT) use have responded to 
the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic from an HIT perspective.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook interviews with 44 healthcare professionals
with a background in informatics from 6 hospitals internationally. Interviews
were informed by a topic guide and were conducted via videoconferencing software.
Thematic analysis was employed to develop a coding framework and identify
emerging themes.
RESULTS: Three themes and 6 subthemes were identified. HITs were employed to
manage time and resources during a surge in patient numbers through fast-tracked 
governance procedures, and the creation of real-time bed capacity tracking within
electronic health records. Improving the integration of different hospital
systems was identified as important across sites. The use of hard-stop alerts and
order sets were perceived as being effective at helping to respond to potential
medication shortages and selecting available drug treatments. Utilizing
information from multiple data sources to develop alerts facilitated treatment.
Finally, the upscaling/optimization of telehealth and remote working capabilities
was used to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection within hospitals.
DISCUSSION: A number of the HIT-related changes implemented at these sites were
perceived to have facilitated more effective patient treatment and management of 
resources. Informaticians generally felt more valued by hospital management as a 
result.
CONCLUSIONS: Improving integration between data systems, utilizing specialized
alerts, and expanding telehealth represent strategies that hospitals should
consider when using HIT for delivering hospital care in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

PURPOSE: Electronic application (app)-based treatment is promising for common
diseases with good conservative management options, such as urinary incontinence 
(UI) in women, but its effectiveness compared with usual care is unclear. This
study set out to determine if app-based treatment for women with stress, urgency,
or mixed UI was noninferior to usual care in the primary care setting.
METHODS: The URinControl trial is a pragmatic, noninferiority randomized
controlled trial in Dutch primary care including adult women with 2 episodes of
UI per week. From July 2015 to July 2018, we screened 350 women for eligibility. 
A stand-alone app-based treatment with pelvic floor muscle and bladder training
(URinControl) was compared with usual care according to the Dutch general
practitioner guideline for UI treatment. Outcomes measured were change in symptom
severity score from baseline to 4 months (primary outcome), impact on
disease-specific quality of life, patient-perceived improvement, and number of UI
episodes. Noninferiority (<1.5 points) was assessed with linear regression
analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 262 eligible women were randomized equally; 195 of them had
follow-up through 4 months. The change in symptom severity with app-based
treatment (-2.16 points; 95% CI, -2.67 to -1.65) was noninferior to that with
usual care (-2.56 points; 95% CI, -3.28 to -1.84), with a mean difference of
0.058 points (95% CI, -0.776 to 0.891) between groups. Neither treatment was
superior to the other, and both groups showed improvements in outcome measures
after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: App-based treatment for women with UI was at least as effective as
usual care in the primary care setting. As such, app-based treatments, with their
potential advantages of privacy, accessibility, and lower cost, may provide women
with a good alternative to consultation.

OBJECTIVE: To ensure the well-being of their patients, health care providers
(HCPs) are putting more effort into the quality of the communication they provide
in oncology clinics. With the emergence of Health Information Technology (HIT),
the dynamics between doctors and patients in oncology settings have changed. The 
purpose of this literature review is to explore and demonstrate how various
health information technologies impact doctor-patient communication in oncology
settings.
METHOD: A systematic literature review was conducted in 4 databases (PubMed,
Cochrane, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore) to select publications that are in
English, published between January 2009 and September 2020. This review reports
outcomes related to the impacts of using health information technologies on
doctor-patient communication according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines
(PRISMA).
RESULTS: We identified 31 studies which satisfied the selection and eligibility
criteria. The review revealed a diverse range of HIT used to support
communication between cancer patients and their HCPs in oncology settings.
Outcomes related to communication were examined to demonstrate how technology can
improve access to care in clinical settings and online. When technology is used
effectively to support patient knowledge and shared understanding, this increases
the patient's satisfaction and ability to manage emotions, make decisions, and
progress in their treatment, in addition to increasing social support and
building a stronger therapeutic alliance based on shared knowledge and
transparency between clinicians and patients.
CONCLUSION: Technology-based solutions can help strengthen the relationship and
communication between patients and their doctors. They can empower the patient's 
well-being, help doctors make better decisions and enhance the therapeutic
alliance between them. Thus, using technology to enhance communication in
healthcare settings remains beneficial if its use is structured and target
oriented. Future studies should focus on comparing in-depth the difference
between outpatient and inpatient settings in terms of the efforts required and
the extent of the impacts from both clinicians' and cancer patients'
perspectives.

The Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology final rule
implementing the interoperability and information blocking provisions of the 21st
Century Cures Act requires support for two SMART (Substitutable Medical
Applications, Reusable Technologies) application programming interfaces (APIs)
and instantiates Health Level Seven International (HL7) Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) as a lingua franca for health data. We sought
to assess the current state and near-term plans for the SMART/HL7 Bulk FHIR
Access API implementation across organizations including electronic health record
vendors, cloud vendors, public health contractors, research institutions, payors,
FHIR tooling developers, and other purveyors of health information technology
platforms. We learned that many organizations not required through regulation to 
use standardized bulk data are rapidly implementing the API for a wide array of
use cases. This may portend an unprecedented level of standardized
population-level health data exchange that will support an apps and analytics
ecosystem. Feedback from early adopters on the API's limitations and unsolved
problems in the space of population health are highlighted.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the practice- and market-level factors associated with the
amount of provider health information exchange (HIE) use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Provider and practice-level data was drawn from the
Meaningful Use Stage 2 Public Use Files from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, the Physician Compare National Downloadable File, and the
Compendium of US Health Systems, among other sources. We analyzed the
relationship between provider HIE use and practice and market factors using
multivariable linear regression and compared primary care providers (PCPs) to
non-PCPs. Provider volume of HIE use is measured as the percentage of referrals
sent with electronic summaries of care (eSCR) reported by eligible providers
attesting to the Meaningful Use electronic health record (EHR) incentive program 
in 2016.
RESULTS: Providers used HIE in 49% of referrals; PCPs used HIE in fewer referrals
(43%) than non-PCPs (57%). Provider use of products from EHR vendors was
negatively related to HIE use, while use of Athenahealth and Greenway Health
products were positively related to HIE use. Providers treating, on average,
older patients and greater proportions of patients with diabetes used HIE for
more referrals. Health system membership, market concentration, and state HIE
consent policy were unrelated to provider HIE use.
DISCUSSION: HIE use during referrals is low among office-based providers with the
capability for exchange, especially PCPs. Practice-level factors were more
commonly associated with greater levels of HIE use than market-level factors.
CONCLUSION: This furthers the understanding that market forces, like competition,
may be related to HIE adoption decisions but are less important for use once
adoption has occurred.

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic hit the German education system unexpectedly
and forced its universities to shift to Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT). The Data
Integration Center (DIC) of the University Hospital Magdeburg and the Institute
of Biometry and Medical Informatics (IBMI) has developed a concept based on
existing structures that can be quickly implemented and used by the Medical
Faculty at Otto von Guericke University. This manuscript focuses on the IT
support for lecturers, which allows them to concentrate on teaching their
lessons, although the authors are aware that this is only a small part of the
entire subject. Additionally, there is a great awareness that ERT can never
replace well-structured in-person classes. Concept: The key feature of the
concept uses the well-working management system for all physical rooms of the
university by designing a virtual video conference room for every physical room. 
This allows high interactivity for lectures and seminars while applying proven
teaching methods. Additionally, a collaboration software system to document all
lessons learned and a technical support team have been available for the teaching
staff. Courses with a hands-on approach require more personal interaction than
lectures. Therefore, the issues of practical trainings have not been solved with 
this concept, but been tackled by using questionnaires and minimizing contacts
during attestations. Applied IT tools: The concept's requirements were met by
Zoom Meetings, Confluence, HIS/LSF and Moodle. Discussion and Conclusion: The
concept helped the lecturers to provide high-quality teaching for students at
universities. Additionally, it allows for a dynamic response to new needs and
problems. The concept will be reviewed as part of a higher Universal Design for
Learning concept and may support lecturers in the following semesters in hybrid
meetings with real and virtual attendees.

Publisher: Hintergrund: Die Covid-19-Pandemie traf das deutsche Bildungssystem
unerwartet und zwang dessen Universitäten, auf „Emergency Remote Teaching“ (ERT) 
umzustellen. Das Datenintegrationszentrum (DIZ) des Universitätsklinikums
Magdeburg und das Institut für Biometrie und Medizinische Informatik (IBMI) haben
auf Grundlage bestehender Strukturen ein Konzept entwickelt, das von der
Medizinischen Fakultät der Otto-von-Guericke-Universität schnell umgesetzt und
genutzt werden konnte. Im Mittelpunkt dieses Manuskripts steht die
IT-Unterstützung der Dozierenden, die es diesen ermöglicht, sich auf die Lehre zu
konzentrieren, wobei den Autoren bewusst ist, dass dies nur einen kleinen Teil
des gesamten Problems abdeckt. Außerdem ist dieses Manuskript unter dem
Bewusstsein verfasst, dass die ERT einen gut strukturierten Präsenzunterricht
niemals ersetzen kann.Konzept: Das Hauptmerkmal des Konzepts ist die weitere
Nutzung des bereits gut funktionierenden Raumverwaltungssystems für alle
existierenden Räume der Universität mithilfe der Einrichtung eines virtuellen
Videokonferenzraums für jeden physischen Raum. Dies ermöglicht eine hohe
Interaktivität für Vorlesungen und Seminare bei weiterer Verwendung bewährter und
gewohnter Lehrmethoden. Zusätzlich wurden ein Kollaborationssoftwaresystem zur
Dokumentation aller gewonnenen Erkenntnisse und typischer Fehler und ein
technisches Support-Team für das Lehrpersonal zur Verfügung gestellt. Da Kurse
mit einem praxisorientierten Ansatz mehr persönliche Interaktion als Vorlesungen 
benötigen, wurden die Anforderungen der Praktika nicht vollständig mit diesem
Konzept gelöst, aber durch die Verwendung von Fragebögen und der Minimierung von 
Kontakten während der Testate angegangen.Angewandte IT-Tools: Die Anforderungen
des Konzepts wurden durch Zoom Meetings, Confluence, HIS/LSF und Moodle
gelöst.Diskussion und Schlussfolgerung: Das Konzept half den Dozierenden den
Studierenden an der Hochschule eine hochqualitative Lehre anzubieten. Darüber
hinaus ermöglicht es eine dynamische Reaktion auf neue Bedürfnisse und Probleme. 
Das Konzept wird im Rahmen eines „Universal Design for Learning“-Konzepts
überprüft und kann die Dozierenden in den folgenden Semestern bei hybriden
Veranstaltungen mit realen und virtuellen Teilnehmern unterstützen.

Electronic health record (EHR) optimization has been identified as a best
practice to reduce burnout and improve user satisfaction; however, measuring
success can be challenging. The goal of this manuscript is to describe the
limitations of measuring optimizations and opportunities to combine assessments
for a more comprehensive evaluation of optimization outcomes. The authors review 
lessons from 3 U.S. healthcare institutions that presented their experiences and 
recommendations at the American Medical Informatics Association 2020 Clinical
Informatics conference, describing uses and limitations of vendor time-based
reports and surveys utilized in optimization programs. Compiling optimization
outcomes supports a multi-faceted approach that can produce assessments even as
time-based reports and technology change. The authors recommend that objective
measures of optimization must be combined with provider and clinician-defined
value to provide long term improvements in user satisfaction and reduce
EHR-related burnout.

Health sciences libraries offer core resources and services to expand the
knowledge and efficiencies of their communities. Increasingly with the growth of 
big data, open data, and electronic health records, clinical and translational
researchers must be more fluent in finding, manipulating, managing, visualizing, 
and sharing data. To meet such needs, libraries are increasingly creating roles
to educate and collaborate on topics related to health informatics and health
data. This column provides examples of the work of the health library
informaticist at the Blaisdell Medical Library, University of California, Davis, 
and how the role facilitates health professions students, faculty and staff to
access, manage, and use data assets and software tools for working with data.

Laboratory Information Systems (LIS) and data visualization techniques have
untapped potential in anatomic pathology laboratories. Pre-built functionalities 
of LIS do not address all the needs of a modern histology laboratory. For
instance, "Go live" is not the end of LIS customization, but just the beginning. 
After closely evaluating various histology lab workflows, we implemented several 
custom data analytics dashboards and additional LIS functionalities to monitor
and address weaknesses. Herein, we present our experience in LIS and
data-tracking solutions that improved trainee education, slide logistics,
staffing/instrumentation lobbying, and task tracking. The latter was addressed
through the creation of a novel "status board" akin to those seen in inpatient
wards. These use-cases can benefit other histology laboratories.

Objectives: The UK Biobank (UKB) is making primary care electronic health records
(EHRs) for 500 000 participants available for COVID-19-related research. Data are
extracted from four sources, recorded using five clinical terminologies and
stored in different schemas. The aims of our research were to: (a) develop a
semi-supervised approach for bootstrapping EHR phenotyping algorithms in UKB EHR,
and (b) to evaluate our approach by implementing and evaluating phenotypes for 31
common biomarkers.
Materials and Methods: We describe an algorithmic approach to phenotyping
biomarkers in primary care EHR involving (a) bootstrapping definitions using
existing phenotypes, (b) excluding generic, rare, or semantically distant terms, 
(c) forward-mapping terminology terms, (d) expert review, and (e) data
extraction. We evaluated the phenotypes by assessing the ability to reproduce
known epidemiological associations with all-cause mortality using Cox
proportional hazards models.
Results: We created and evaluated phenotyping algorithms for 31 biomarkers many
of which are directly related to COVID-19 complications, for example diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease. Our algorithm identified 1651 Read
v2 and Clinical Terms Version 3 terms and automatically excluded 1228 terms.
Clinical review excluded 103 terms and included 44 terms, resulting in 364 terms 
for data extraction (sensitivity 0.89, specificity 0.92). We extracted 38 190 682
events and identified 220 978 participants with at least one biomarker measured.
Discussion and conclusion: Bootstrapping phenotyping algorithms from similar EHR 
can potentially address pre-existing methodological concerns that undermine the
outputs of biomarker discovery pipelines and provide research-quality phenotyping
algorithms.

OBJECTIVE: To create an informatics supportive tool, which can assist healthcare 
professionals in estimating potential requirements for essential drug supplies to
respond to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic based on epidemiological forecasting.
METHODS: The tool was based on a Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR)
epidemiological model in which the population is divided into three compartments 
and transmission parameters are specified to define the rate at which people move
between stages. Appropriate data entry was guaranteed by the creation of
structured guided paths. The drugs needed for the forecasted patients were
estimated according to a list of critical care drugs compiled by consulting
previous published scientific works, national and international guidelines. For
each drug, an estimation was made of the percentage average ICU uptake for each
therapeutic group and active principle.
RESULTS: The tool consists of a Microsoft Excel template that is based on the
initial epidemiological situation, the non-pharmaceutical interventions applied, 
the risk of hospitalisation based on the population age distribution, and the
hospital beds available. The tool provides a forecast of which patients with
COVID-19 will need to be treated in a hospital setting. The number of patients is
used to estimate the drugs needed based on the average daily dose and the
treatment length of each drug. The possibility of editing the type of
distribution (exponential or linear) of the number of patients at the beginning
of the analysis, the percentage adherence with non-pharmaceutical interventions
and their delayed effect, and all the key epidemiological parameters make the
estimation tailorable to different clinical contexts and needs.
CONCLUSIONS: This model might be an effective supporting tool that could be
easily implemented within the workflow of health professionals. All the
information reported in this paper could be useful in developing new strategies
to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVES: We incorporated the Korean Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
vocabulary into Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabulary
using a semi-automated process. The goal of this study was to improve the Korean 
EDI as a standard medical ontology in Korea.
METHODS: We incorporated the EDI vocabulary into OMOP vocabulary through four
main steps. First, we improved the current classification of EDI domains and
separated medical services into procedures and measurements. Second, each EDI
concept was assigned a unique identifier and validity dates. Third, we built a
vertical hierarchy between EDI concepts, fully describing child concepts through 
relationships and attributes and linking them to parent terms. Finally, we added 
an English definition for each EDI concept. We translated the Korean definitions 
of EDI concepts using Google.Cloud.Translation.V3, using a client library and
manual translation. We evaluated the EDI using 11 auditing criteria for
controlled vocabularies.
RESULTS: We incorporated 313,431 concepts from the EDI to the OMOP Standardized
Vocabularies. For 10 of the 11 auditing criteria, EDI showed a better quality
index within the OMOP vocabulary than in the original EDI vocabulary.
CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of the EDI vocabulary into the OMOP Standardized
Vocabularies allows better standardization to facilitate network research. Our
research provides a promising model for mapping Korean medical information into a
global standard terminology system, although a comprehensive mapping of official 
vocabulary remains to be done in the future.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to introduce the Systematized
Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), to describe use cases of
SNOMED CT with the barriers and facilitators, and finally, to propose strategies 
for adopting and implementing SNOMED CT in Korea as a member of SNOMED
International.
METHODS: We reviewed a collection of SNOMED CT documents, such as introductory
materials, practical guides, technical specifications, and reference materials
provided by SNOMED International and the literature on SNOMED CT published by
researchers to identify use cases of SNOMED CT with barriers and facilitators. We
also surveyed the attendees of SNOMED CT education and training series offered by
the Korea Human Resource Development Institute for Health and Welfare to identify
perceived barriers to adopting SNOMED CT in Korea.
RESULTS: We identified the barriers and facilitators to adopt SNOMED CT
experienced by international terminology experts and prospective Korean users.
They were related to governance and infrastructure, support services for use,
education and training programs, use cases, and vendor capability to implement
SNOMED CT. Based on these findings, we identified strategies for adopting and
implementing SNOMED CT in Korea. They included the establishment of SNOMED CT
management infrastructure, the development of SNOMED CT education and training
programs for various user groups, the provision of support services for SNOMED CT
use, and the development of SNOMED CT use cases.
CONCLUSIONS: These strategies for the adoption and implementation of SNOMED CT
need to be executed step by step.

Renal transplantation is a complex, multi-disciplinary and cross-center service. 
Clinical pathways naturally traverse specialty and organizational boundaries as
patients transition from chronic kidney disease to renal failure and ultimately
transplantation. Health information technology (IT) has the potential to support 
transplant care by improving access to data, information sharing and
communication. This novel review aimed to identify and characterize health IT
solutions in renal transplantation, and where possible evaluate any intended
benefits. A systematic literature review was conducted of studies covering any
part of the clinical pathway, with end-users being clinical staff or patients.
Interventions were characterized and evaluated for achieved benefits using the
World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Digital Health Interventions
and the mixed methods assessment tool (MMAT) was used to determine the quality of
experimental studies. Of 4498 articles, 12 descriptive and 6 experimental studies
met the inclusion criteria. Median MMAT percentage score of experimental studies 
was 64 (i.q.r. 57 to 74.8). The most frequent functionality of technology
involved overcoming communication roadblocks and improving access to data.
Intended benefits included improving information management and supporting
workflow, however only one study reported evaluated results. Six patient-facing
applications that primarily addressed adherence-to-treatment were identified,
five of which were evaluated for intended benefits, showing overall positive
results. Overall, despite transplantation being well suited to health IT
interventions, this review demonstrates a scarcity of literature in this field. A
small number of clinician- and patient-facing IT solutions have been reported,
albeit mostly in non-experimental studies. Due to this lack of formal evaluation,
the effectiveness of solutions remains unclear. High-quality evaluative studies
are required to develop effective IT solutions that improve clinical care.

Electronic health record patient portals allow patients to access their own
health data online and interact with the healthcare team. Many studies have
focused on use of patient portals in the outpatient setting. Relatively less is
known about use of patient portals for hospitalized patients. The data in this
article include analysis of patient portal activation and utilization for adults 
hospitalized in 2018 at an academic medical center in a Midwestern state in the
United States. Activation was assessed by percentage of patients who had
activated their patient portal by the time of data review. Utilization of the
patient portal was determined by whether patients or their legal proxies accessed
one or more reports from diagnostic testing ordered during inpatient encounter(s)
in 2018. The data include 826,843 diagnostic tests on 40,640 unique patients.
Patient characteristics include sex, age, whether outpatient diagnostic tests
were also performed in 2018, preferred language (English or non-English), health 
insurance status (private, public, or uninsured), self-declared race (White or
non-White), and whether there was a legal proxy for the patient. Association of
these covariates with patient portal activation and utilization were analyzed.

BACKGROUND: Rare Diseases (RDs) are difficult to diagnose. Clinical Decision
Support Systems (CDSS) could support the diagnosis for RDs. The Medical
Informatics in Research and Medicine (MIRACUM) consortium developed a CDSS for
RDs based on distributed clinical data from eight German university hospitals. To
support the diagnosis for difficult patient cases, the CDSS uses data from the
different hospitals to perform a patient similarity analysis to obtain an
indication of a diagnosis. To optimize our CDSS, we conducted a qualitative study
to investigate usability and functionality of our designed CDSS.
METHODS: We performed a Thinking Aloud Test (TA-Test) with RDs experts working in
Rare Diseases Centers (RDCs) at MIRACUM locations which are specialized in
diagnosis and treatment of RDs. An instruction sheet with tasks was prepared that
the participants should perform with the CDSS during the study. The TA-Test was
recorded on audio and video, whereas the resulting transcripts were analysed with
a qualitative content analysis, as a ruled-guided fixed procedure to analyse
text-based data. Furthermore, a questionnaire was handed out at the end of the
study including the System Usability Scale (SUS).
RESULTS: A total of eight experts from eight MIRACUM locations with an
established RDC were included in the study. Results indicate that more detailed
information about patients, such as descriptive attributes or findings, can help 
the system perform better. The system was rated positively in terms of
functionality, such as functions that enable the user to obtain an overview of
similar patients or medical history of a patient. However, there is a lack of
transparency in the results of the CDSS patient similarity analysis. The study
participants often stated that the system should present the user with an
overview of exact symptoms, diagnosis, and other characteristics that define two 
patients as similar. In the usability section, the CDSS received a score of 73.21
points, which is ranked as good usability.
CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study investigated the usability and functionality 
of a CDSS of RDs. Despite positive feedback about functionality of system, the
CDSS still requires some revisions and improvement in transparency of the patient
similarity analysis.

BACKGROUND: Despite broad efforts to improve the reporting of biomedical
research, no reporting guideline exists for primary care (PC) research. Little is
known about current reporting practices or how well reports meet the needs of
varied users in PC.
OBJECTIVE: To map the published literature on PC research reporting: quality,
strengths and weaknesses, recommendations and efforts to improve reporting.
METHODS: Scoping review of literature across seven major databases and search
engines to identify all articles on PC research reporting published in English,
2000-20. An additional secondary search of references of these 25 articles and
consideration of expert panel suggestions. Structured data extraction by multiple
reviewers using a predetermined form.
RESULTS: Search yielded 2847 unique titles, of which 126 underwent full-text
review and 25 met inclusion criteria. Publications included opinion pieces (9),
systematic reviews (5), methods articles (2), literature reviews (4), qualitative
studies (4) and surveys (1). Studies focussed on a variety of topics and research
methods. All publications identified the need for improved reporting and
recommended items to include in reports. Most commonly, publications cited the
need for more detailed reporting on the context of study interventions, clinical 
settings and health care systems. Most publications endorsed the use of reporting
guidelines and recognized the unique needs of PC research reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: Published research and opinion identify unique needs for PC research
reports and support new guidance to improve the validity, generalizability and
application of study findings.

plain-language-summary: Doctors and health scientists recognize the need to
improve the way they report their research. Despite the key role of primary care 
(PC) in strong health care systems, none of the many reporting guidelines focuses
on PC research. To understand what is known about reporting PC research, we
systematically searched all scientific articles published in English 2000–20. We 
studied the 25 key articles, which dealt with a great variety of patients,
populations, medical problems and research methods. These articles identified
needs for improvement and suggested items to include or ways to communicate
research findings more effectively to the variety of readers who must put new
research into practice to improve patient care and community health. These
readers—practicing clinicians, researchers, patients, teachers and
policymakers—need more practical details to understand the context and setting
where the research took place and the patients were treated. Readers need better 
reporting of context to help them judge how they can apply the new research
knowledge in their own practices. This review helped identify items to include
and ways to improve research reports that can help develop new guidelines for PC 
research reports.

BACKGROUND: The adoption rate of electronic health records (EHRs) in hospitals
has become a main index to measure digitalization in medicine in each country.
OBJECTIVE: This study summarizes and shares the experiences with EHR adoption in 
China and in the United States.
METHODS: Using the 2007-2018 annual hospital survey data from the Chinese Health 
Information Management Association (CHIMA) and the 2008-2017 United States
American Hospital Association Information Technology Supplement survey data, we
compared the trends in EHR adoption rates in China and the United States. We then
used the Bass model to fit these data and to analyze the modes of diffusion of
EHRs in these 2 countries. Finally, using the 2007, 2010, and 2014 CHIMA and
Healthcare Information and Management Systems Services survey data, we analyzed
the major challenges faced by hospitals in China and the United States in
developing health information technology.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2018, the average adoption rates of the sampled hospitals
in China increased from 18.6% to 85.3%, compared to the increase from 9.4% to 96%
in US hospitals from 2008 to 2017. The annual average adoption rates in Chinese
and US hospitals were 6.1% and 9.6%, respectively. However, the annual average
number of hospitals adopting EHRs was 1500 in China and 534 in the US, indicating
that the former might require more effort. Both countries faced similar major
challenges for hospital digitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: The adoption rates of hospital EHRs in China and the United States
have both increased significantly in the past 10 years. The number of hospitals
that adopted EHRs in China exceeded 16,000, which was 3.3 times that of the 4814 
nonfederal US hospitals. This faster adoption outcome may have been a benefit of 
top-level design and government-led policies, particularly the inclusion of EHR
adoption as an important indicator for performance evaluation and the appointment
of public hospitals.

Health and biomedical informatics graduate-level degree programs have
proliferated across the United States in the last 10 years. To help inform
programs on practices in teaching and learning, a survey of master's programs in 
health and biomedical informatics in the United States was conducted to determine
the national landscape of culminating experiences including capstone projects,
research theses, internships, and practicums. Almost all respondents reported
that their programs required a culminating experience (97%). A paper (not a
formal thesis), an oral presentation, a formal course, and an internship were
required by ≥50% programs. The most commonly reported purposes for the
culminating experience were to help students extend and apply the learning and as
a bridge to the workplace. The biggest challenges were students' maturity,
difficulty in synthesizing information into a coherent paper, and ability to
generate research ideas. The results provide students and program leaders with a 
summary of pedagogical methods across programs.

AIMS: Cellular pathology ('e-pathology') record sets are a rich data resource
with which to populate the electronic patient record (EPR). Accessible reports,
even decades old, can be of great value in contemporary clinical decision making 
and as a resource for longitudinal clinical research. The aim of this short paper
is to describe a solution in a major UK University Hospital which gives immediate
visibility and clinical utility to 30 years of e-pathology records METHODS: Over 
the past decade, we have created a timeline structured and iconographic data
framework for the 'whole-of-life' visualisation of the entirety of an EPR. We
have enhanced this interface with the sequential extraction of 373 342
e-pathology reports from legacy Ferranti (1990-1997) and Masterlab (1997-2004)
files. They have been uploaded into our SQL file servers, following appropriate
data quality and patient identity reconciliation checks.
RESULTS: We have restored a large repository of previously inaccessible
e-pathology records to clinical use and to immediacy of access as a foundation
element of our timeline structured EPR. This process has also allowed us to
populate and validate an EPR-integral breast cancer data system of 20 000 cases
with e-pathology records dating back to 1990.
CONCLUSIONS: The revitalisation of old e-pathology reports into a timeline
structured EPR creates preserves and upcycles the investment in pathology
reporting which is otherwise progressively lost to clinical use. E-pathology
records provide reliable, life-long evidence of critical transition points in
individual lives and disease progression for clinical and research use, when they
can be instantly accessed.

BACKGROUND: Given the established links between an individual's behaviors and
lifestyle factors and potentially adverse health outcomes, univariate or simple
multivariate health metrics and scores have been developed to quantify general
health at a given point in time and estimate risk of negative future outcomes.
However, these health metrics may be challenging for widespread use and are
unlikely to be successful at capturing the broader determinants of health in the 
general population. Hence, there is a need for a multidimensional yet widely
employable and accessible way to obtain a comprehensive health metric.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop and validate a novel, easily
interpretable, points-based health score ("C-Score") derived from metrics
measurable using smartphone components and iterations thereof that utilize
statistical modeling and machine learning (ML) approaches.
METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify relevant predictor
variables for inclusion in the first iteration of a points-based model. This was 
followed by a prospective cohort study in a UK Biobank population for the
purposes of validating the C-Score and developing and comparatively validating
variations of the score using statistical and ML models to assess the balance
between expediency and ease of interpretability and model complexity. Primary and
secondary outcome measures were discrimination of a points-based score for
all-cause mortality within 10 years (Harrell c-statistic) and discrimination and 
calibration of Cox proportional hazards models and ML models that incorporate
C-Score values (or raw data inputs) and other predictors to predict the risk of
all-cause mortality within 10 years.
RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 420,560 individuals. During a cohort
follow-up of 4,526,452 person-years, there were 16,188 deaths from any cause
(3.85%). The points-based model had good discrimination (c-statistic=0.66). There
was a 31% relative reduction in risk of all-cause mortality per decile of
increasing C-Score (hazard ratio of 0.69, 95% CI 0.663-0.675). A Cox model
integrating age and C-Score had improved discrimination (8 percentage points;
c-statistic=0.74) and good calibration. ML approaches did not offer improved
discrimination over statistical modeling.
CONCLUSIONS: The novel health metric ("C-Score") has good predictive capabilities
for all-cause mortality within 10 years. Embedding the C-Score within a
smartphone app may represent a useful tool for democratized, individualized
health risk prediction. A simple Cox model using C-Score and age balances
parsimony and accuracy of risk predictions and could be used to produce absolute 
risk estimations for app users.

Clinicians often attribute much of their burnout experience to use of the
electronic health record, the adoption of which was greatly accelerated by the
Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009. That 
same year, AMIA's Policy Meeting focused on possible unintended consequences
associated with rapid implementation of electronic health records, generating 17 
potential consequences and 15 recommendations to address them. At the 2020 annual
meeting of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), ACMI fellows
participated in a modified Delphi process to assess the accuracy of the 2009
predictions and the response to the recommendations. Among the findings, the
fellows concluded that the degree of clinician burnout and its contributing
factors, such as increased documentation requirements, were significantly
underestimated. Conversely, problems related to identify theft and fraud were
overestimated. Only 3 of the 15 recommendations were adjudged more than
half-addressed.

The amount of information in the scientific literature of the bio-medical domain 
is growing exponentially, which makes it difficult in developing a smart medical 
system. Summarization techniques help for efficient searching and understanding
of relevant information from the medical documents. In the paper, an evolutionary
algorithm based ensemble extractive summarization technique is devised as a smart
medical application with the idea of hybrid artificial intelligence on natural
language processing. We have considered the abstracts of the target article and
its cited articles as the base summaries and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm is applied for generating the ensemble summary of the target article.
Each sentence of the base summaries is represented by a concept vector of the
medical terms contained in it with the help of the Unified Modelling Language
System (UMLS) tool which is widely used in various smart medical applications.
These terms carry the key information of the sentence which is very useful to
find out the semantic similarity among the sentences. Fitness functions of the
evolutionary algorithm are mainly defined using clustering coefficient and
sparsity index, the concepts of graph theory. After the convergence of the
algorithm, the best solution of the final population gives the ensemble summary. 
Next, the semantic similarity of each sentence in the target article with the
ensemble summary is calculated and the sentences which are most similar to the
ensemble summary are considered as the summary of the target article. The method 
is applied to the articles available in the PubMed MEDLINE database system and
experimental results are compared with some state of the art methods applied in
the Bio-medical domain. Experimental results and comparative study based on the
performance evaluation show that the method competes with some recently proposed 
summarization methods and outperforms others, which express the effectiveness of 
the proposed methodology. Different statistical tests have also been made to
observe that the method is statistically significant.

OBJECTIVE: The Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (4CE) 
is an international collaboration addressing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
with federated analyses of electronic health record (EHR) data. We sought to
develop and validate a computable phenotype for COVID-19 severity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve 4CE sites participated. First, we developed an
EHR-based severity phenotype consisting of 6 code classes, and we validated it on
patient hospitalization data from the 12 4CE clinical sites against the outcomes 
of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and/or death. We also piloted an
alternative machine learning approach and compared selected predictors of
severity with the 4CE phenotype at 1 site.
RESULTS: The full 4CE severity phenotype had pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and
specificity 0.83 for the combined outcome of ICU admission and/or death. The
sensitivity of individual code categories for acuity had high variability-up to
0.65 across sites. At one pilot site, the expert-derived phenotype had mean area 
under the curve of 0.903 (95% confidence interval, 0.886-0.921), compared with an
area under the curve of 0.956 (95% confidence interval, 0.952-0.959) for the
machine learning approach. Billing codes were poor proxies of ICU admission, with
as low as 49% precision and recall compared with chart review.
DISCUSSION: We developed a severity phenotype using 6 code classes that proved
resilient to coding variability across international institutions. In contrast,
machine learning approaches may overfit hospital-specific orders. Manual chart
review revealed discrepancies even in the gold-standard outcomes, possibly owing 
to heterogeneous pandemic conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an EHR-based severity phenotype for COVID-19 in
hospitalized patients and validated it at 12 international sites.

The ubiquity of EHRs in healthcare means that small EHR inefficiencies can have a
major impact on clinician workload. We conducted a sequential explanatory mixed
methods study to: 1) identify EHR-associated workload and usability effects for
clinicians following an EHR change over time, 2) determine workload and usability
differences for providers (MD and Advance Practice Nurses) versus nurses (RNs and
MAs), 3) determine if usability predicts workload, 4) identify potential sources 
of EHR design flaws. Workload (NASA-Task Load Index) and usability (System
Usability Scale) measures were administered pre, 6-8 month and 30-32 months
post-implementation. We found significant increase in perceived workload
post-implementation that persisted for 2.5 years (p < .001). The workload
increase was associated with usability ratings, which in turn may relate to EHR
interface design violations identified by a heuristic evaluation. Our findings
suggest further innovation and attention to interface design flaws are needed to 
improve EHR usability and reduce clinician workload.

OBJECTIVE: This study sought to describe gender representation in leadership and 
recognition within the U.S. biomedical informatics community.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from public websites or provided by
American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) personnel from 2017 to 2019,
including gender of membership, directors of academic informatics programs,
clinical informatics subspecialty fellowships, AMIA leadership (2014-2019), and
AMIA awardees (1993-2019). Differences in gender proportions were calculated
using chi-square tests.
RESULTS: Men were more often in leadership positions and award recipients
(P < .01). Men led 74.7% (n = 71 of 95) of academic informatics programs and
83.3% (n = 35 of 42) of clinical informatics fellowships. Within AMIA, men held
56.8% (n = 1086 of 1913) of leadership roles and received 64.1% (n = 59 of 92) of
awards.
DISCUSSION: As in other STEM fields, leadership and recognition in biomedical
informatics is lower for women.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying gender inequity should inform data-driven strategies to 
foster diversity and inclusion. Standardized collection and surveillance of
demographic data within biomedical informatics is necessary.

Machine learning algorithms are being used to screen and diagnose disease,
prognosticate and predict therapeutic responses. Hundreds of new algorithms are
being developed, but whether they improve clinical decision making and patient
outcomes remains uncertain. If clinicians are to use algorithms, they need to be 
reassured that key issues relating to their validity, utility, feasibility,
safety and ethical use have been addressed. We propose a checklist of 10
questions that clinicians can ask of those advocating for the use of a particular
algorithm, but which do not expect clinicians, as non-experts, to demonstrate
mastery over what can be highly complex statistical and computational concepts.
The questions are: (1) What is the purpose and context of the algorithm? (2) How 
good were the data used to train the algorithm? (3) Were there sufficient data to
train the algorithm? (4) How well does the algorithm perform? (5) Is the
algorithm transferable to new clinical settings? (6) Are the outputs of the
algorithm clinically intelligible? (7) How will this algorithm fit into and
complement current workflows? (8) Has use of the algorithm been shown to improve 
patient care and outcomes? (9) Could the algorithm cause patient harm? and (10)
Does use of the algorithm raise ethical, legal or social concerns? We provide
examples where an algorithm may raise concerns and apply the checklist to a
recent review of diagnostic imaging applications. This checklist aims to assist
clinicians in assessing algorithm readiness for routine care and identify
situations where further refinement and evaluation is required prior to
large-scale use.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused strains on health systems worldwide disrupting
routine hospital services for all non-COVID patients. Within this retrospective
study, we analyzed inpatient hospital admissions across 18 German university
hospitals during the 2020 lockdown period compared to 2018. Patients admitted to 
hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2020 and the corresponding periods in 2018
and 2019 were included in this study. Data derived from electronic health records
were collected and analyzed using the data integration center infrastructure
implemented in the university hospitals that are part of the four consortia
funded by the German Medical Informatics Initiative. Admissions were grouped and 
counted by ICD 10 chapters and specific reasons for treatment at each site.
Pooled aggregated data were centrally analyzed with descriptive statistics to
compare absolute and relative differences between time periods of different
years. The results illustrate how care process adoptions depended on the COVID-19
epidemiological situation and the criticality of the disease. Overall inpatient
hospital admissions decreased by 35% in weeks 1 to 4 and by 30.3% in weeks 5 to 8
after the lockdown announcement compared to 2018. Even hospital admissions for
critical care conditions such as malignant cancer treatments were reduced. We
also noted a high reduction of emergency admissions such as myocardial infarction
(38.7%), whereas the reduction in stroke admissions was smaller (19.6%). In
contrast, we observed a considerable reduction in admissions for non-critical
clinical situations, such as hysterectomies for benign tumors (78.8%) and hip
replacements due to arthrosis (82.4%). In summary, our study shows that the
university hospital admission rates in Germany were substantially reduced
following the national COVID-19 lockdown. These included critical care or
emergency conditions in which deferral is expected to impair clinical outcomes.
Future studies are needed to delineate how appropriate medical care of critically
ill patients can be maintained during a pandemic.

[Potential for Big Data Analysis Using AI in the Field of Clinical Pharmacy].

[Article in Japanese]

(1)M&B Collaboration Medical Corporation Hokuetsu Hospital.

Industrial reforms utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) have advanced
remarkably in recent years. The application of AI to big data analysis in the
medical information field has also been advancing and is expected to be used to
find drug adverse effects that cannot be predicted by conventional methods. We
have developed an adverse drug reactions analysis system that uses machine
learning and data from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database.
The system was developed using the C# programming language and incorporates the
open source machine learning library Accord.Net. Potential analytical
capabilities of the system include discovering unknown drug adverse effects and
evaluating drug-induced adverse events in pharmaceutical management. However, to 
apply the system to pharmaceutical management, it is important to examine the
characteristics and suitability of the level of AI used in the system and to
select statistical methods or machine learning when appropriate. If these points 
are addressed, there is potential for pharmaceutical management to be
individualized and optimized in the clinical setting by using the developed
system to analyze big data. The system also has the potential to allow individual
healthcare facilities such as hospitals and pharmacies to contribute to drug
repositioning, including the discovery of new efficacies, interactions, and drug 
adverse events.

Renal medication-related clinical decision support (CDS) alerts and overrides in 
the inpatient setting following implementation of a commercial electronic health 
record: implications for designing more effective alerts.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the appropriateness of medication-related clinical decision 
support (CDS) alerts associated with renal insufficiency and the potential/actual
harm from overriding the alerts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Override rate frequency was recorded for all inpatients
who had a renal CDS alert trigger between 05/2017 and 04/2018. Two random samples
of 300 for each of 2 types of medication-related CDS alerts associated with renal
insufficiency-"dose change" and "avoid medication"-were evaluated by 2
independent reviewers using predetermined criteria for appropriateness of alert
trigger, appropriateness of override, and patient harm.
RESULTS: We identified 37 100 "dose change" and 5095 "avoid medication" alerts in
the population evaluated, and 100% of each were overridden. Dose change triggers 
were classified as 12.5% appropriate and overrides of these alerts classified as 
90.5% appropriate. Avoid medication triggers were classified as 29.6% appropriate
and overrides 76.5% appropriate. We identified 5 adverse drug events, and, of
these, 4 of the 5 were due to inappropriately overridden alerts.
CONCLUSION: Alerts were nearly always presented inappropriately and were all
overridden during the 1-year period studied. Alert fatigue resulting from
receiving too many poor-quality alerts may result in failure to recognize errors 
that could lead to patient harm. Although medication-related CDS alerts
associated with renal insufficiency had previously been found to be the most
clinically beneficial alerts in a legacy system, in this system they were
ineffective. These findings underscore the need for improvements in alert design,
implementation, and monitoring of alert performance to make alerts more
patient-specific and clinically appropriate.

clinical trial implementation. The objective of this study was to test the
hypothesis that the IPCS could feasibly be used to automate recruitment and
enrolment for a clinical trial.
METHODS: In medical-surgical units, we used the IPCS to randomise, recruit and
consent eligible subjects. For participants not interacting with IPCS study
materials within 48 hours, study staff-initiated recruitment in-person. Eligible 
study population included all caregivers and any patients >6 years old admitted
to medical-surgical units and oncology units September 2015 to January 2016.
OUTCOMES: randomisation assessed using between-group comparisons of patient
characteristics; recruitment success assessed by rates of consent; paperless
implementation using successful acquisition of electronic signature and email
address. We used χ2 analysis to assess success of randomisation and recruitment.
RESULTS: Randomisation was successful (n=1012 randomised, p>0.05 for all
between-group comparisons). For the subset of eligible, randomised patients who
were recruited, IPCS-only recruitment (consented: 2.4% of n=213) was less
successful than in-person recruitment (61.4% of n=87 eligible recruited,
p<0.001). For those consenting (n=61), 96.7% provided an electronic signature and
68.9% provided email addresses.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that as a tool at the bedside, the IPCS offers
key efficiencies for study implementation, including randomisation and collecting
e-consent and contact information, but does not offer recruitment efficiencies.
Further research could assess the value that interactive technologies bring to
recruitment when paired with in-person efforts, potentially focusing on more
intensive user-interface testing for recruitment materials.

BACKGROUND: When an outbreak emerged, each country needs a coherent and
preventive plan to deal with epidemics. In the era of technology, adopting
informatics-based solutions is essential. The main objective of this study is to 
propose a conceptual framework to provide a rapid and responsive surveillance
system against pandemics.
METHODS: A three-step approach was employed in this research to develop a
conceptual framework. These three steps comprise (1) literature review, (2)
extracting and coding concepts, and determining main themes based on thematic
analysis using ATLAS.ti® software, and (3) mapping concepts. Later, all of the
results synthesized under expert consultation to design a conceptual framework
based on the main themes and identified strategies related to medical
informatics.
RESULTS: In the literature review phase, 65 articles were identified as eligible 
studies for analysis. Through line by line coding in thematic analysis, more than
46 themes were extracted as potential foremost themes. Based on the key themes
and strategies were employed by studies, the proposed framework designed in three
main components. The most appropriate strategies that can be used in each section
were identified based on the demands of each part and the available solutions.
These solutions were employed in the final framework.
CONCLUSION: The presented model in this study can be the first step for a better 
understanding of the potential of medical informatics solutions in promoting
epidemic disease management. It can be applied as a reference model for designing
intelligent surveillance systems to prepare for probable future pandemics.

INTRODUCTION: Precision or personalized Medicine (PM) is used for the prevention 
and treatment of diseases by considering a huge amount of information about
individuals variables. Due to high volume of information, AI-based computational 
models are required. A large set of studies conducted to examine the PM approach 
to improve childhood clinical outcomes. Thus, the main goal of this study was to 
review the application of health information technology and especially artificial
intelligence (AI) methods for the treatment of childhood disease using PM.
METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched up to
December 18, 2019. Articles that focused on informatics applications for
childhood disease PM included in this study. Included papers were classified for 
qualitative analysis and interpreting results. The results were analyzed using
Microsoft Excel 2019.
RESULTS: From 341 citations, 62 papers met our inclusion criteria. The number of 
published papers that used AI methods to apply for PM in childhood diseases
increased from 2010 to 2019. Our results showed that most applied methods were
related to machine learning discipline. In terms of clinical scope, the largest
number of clinical articles are devoted to oncology. Besides, the analysis showed
that genomics was the most PM approach used regarding childhood disease.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review examined papers that used AI methods for
applying PM approaches in childhood diseases from medical informatics
perspectives. Thus, it provided new insight to researchers who are interested in 
knowing research needs in this field.

Utilization of Smartphone Depth Mapping Cameras for App-Based Grading of Facial
Movement Disorders: Development and Feasibility Study.

and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: For the classification of facial paresis, various systems of
description and evaluation in the form of clinician-graded or software-based
scoring systems are available. They serve the purpose of scientific and clinical 
assessment of the spontaneous course of the disease or monitoring therapeutic
interventions. Nevertheless, none have been able to achieve universal acceptance 
in everyday clinical practice. Hence, a quick and precise tool for assessing the 
functional status of the facial nerve would be desirable. In this context, the
possibilities that the TrueDepth camera of recent iPhone models offer have
sparked our interest.
OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the utilization of the iPhone's TrueDepth camera 
via a specially developed app prototype for quick, objective, and reproducible
quantification of facial asymmetries.
METHODS: After conceptual and user interface design, a native app prototype for
iOS was programmed that accesses and processes the data of the TrueDepth camera. 
Using a special algorithm, a new index for the grading of unilateral facial
paresis ranging from 0% to 100% was developed. The algorithm was adapted to the
well-established Stennert index by weighting the individual facial regions based 
on functional and cosmetic aspects. Test measurements with healthy subjects using
the app were performed in order to prove the reliability of the system.
RESULTS: After the development process, the app prototype had no runtime or
buildtime errors and also worked under suboptimal conditions such as different
measurement angles, so it met our criteria for a safe and reliable app. The newly
defined index expresses the result of the measurements as a generally
understandable percentage value for each half of the face. The measurements that 
correctly rated the facial expressions of healthy individuals as symmetrical in
all cases were reproducible and showed no statistically significant intertest
variability.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experience with the app prototype assessing healthy
subjects, the use of the TrueDepth camera should have considerable potential for 
app-based grading of facial movement disorders. The app and its algorithm, which 
is based on theoretical considerations, should be evaluated in a prospective
clinical study and correlated with common facial scores.

OBJECTIVE: : To improve understanding of real-world asthma treatment and inform
physician education, we evaluated regional variation in asthma prevalence and
oral corticosteroid (OCS) use across Germany.
METHODS: : We developed a machine learning gradient-boosted tree model with IMS® 
Disease Analyzer electronic medical records, which cover 3% of German patients.
This model had a 91% accuracy in predicting the presence of asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. We applied the model to the IMS® Longitudinal
Prescription database, with 82% national coverage, to classify patients receiving
treatment for airflow obstruction from October 2017-September 2018 in 63 regions 
in Germany.
RESULTS: : Of 2.4 million individuals under statutory health insurance predicted 
to have asthma, 13.7%, 18.7%, 36.5%, 29.4%, and 1.7% received treatment
classified as Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Steps 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,
respectively. Approximately 7-15% of those at GINA Steps 1-4 and 35% at Step 5
treatment received ≥1 acute OCS prescription (duration <10 days). Of patients
receiving GINA Steps 1-4 and Step 5 treatments, 1-3% and 86%, respectively,
received ≥1 high-dosage OCS prescription. Cumulative OCS dosage and percentages
of patients receiving OCS differed substantially across regions, and regions with
lower OCS use had greater use of biologic therapies.
CONCLUSIONS: : Both acute and high OCS use varied regionally across Germany, with
overall use suggesting patients are considerable risk of adverse effects and
long-term health consequences.

BACKGROUND: The most important reason for vaccination delay is the unawareness of
the parents of vaccination schedule. The use of reminders can result in better
vaccination coverage.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the preferred method of receiving
vaccination reminders from the parents' perspective.
STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
METHODS: We studied the parents of under 7-year-old children who visited one of
the six urban health centres in Mashhad for vaccination of their children in
2017. Three hundred parents were participated based on the convenience sampling
method. Data were collected using a questionnaire consisting of five sections.
Five Medical Informatics specialists confirmed the validity of the questionnaire.
The data were analysed by descriptive-inferential statistics and the significance
level was set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Around 94% of the participants wanted to be reminded about their
children's vaccination schedule. Most of them (74.3%) preferred to receive
reminders by short text messaging (SMS) and 42% preferred to be reminded 1 day
before the vaccination date (n = 42%). The tendency to receive reminders and the 
preferred method had no significant correlation with participants' age, education
degree and residential area.
CONCLUSIONS: The preferred reminder method from the parents' perspective was SMS.
Despite the growth of information technology as well as people's access to the
Internet, it seems that use of other methods such as SMS to remind and
specifically educate parents in this respect is more common.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the agreement in diagnosis and management plans reached
between clinicians reviewing eyelid lesions remotely and in face-to-face clinics.
METHODS: In this single-centre observational case series, data were prospectively
collected on 50 consecutive adults referred with eyelid lesions suitable to be
seen by a nurse. A proforma was completed to gather salient information. A nurse 
specialist saw patients in face-to-face clinics and collected information using
the proforma, devising a diagnosis and management plan. Photographs of the eyelid
lesions were taken by a medical photographer. A subsequent remote review was
completed by an oculoplastic consultant using the proforma information and
photographs in the absence of the patient. The diagnosis and management plan
constructed by the nurse specialist were compared with those reached by the
consultant.
RESULTS: Complete data were available for 44 consecutive cases. There was an
overall 91% agreement (40 cases out of 44) between the diagnoses reached by the
nurse specialist, and the remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to
0.99). There was an overall 82% agreement (36 out of 44 cases) in the management 
plans devised by the nurse-led clinic and remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.74
(95% CI 0.58 to 0.90). The average time taken for a remote reviewer to reach a
diagnosis and management plan was 1 min and 20 s.
CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the feasibility of assessing eyelid lesions
using asynchronous telemedicine. There was overall a high rate of concordance in 
the diagnosis reached, and management devised between the clinic and remote
review.

Rationale: The increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) coincides
with a severe shortage of sleep physicians. There is a need for widescale
home-sleep-testing devices with accurate automated scoring to accelerate access
to treatment.Objectives: To examine the accuracy of an automated apnea-index
(AHI) derived from spectral analysis of cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) extracted 
from electrocardiograms, combined with oximetry signals, in relation to
polysomnograms (PSGs).Methods: Electrocardiograms and pulse-oximeter tracings on 
PSGs from APPLES (Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study) were
analyzed. Distinct CPC spectral bands were combined with the oxygen desaturation 
index to create a derived AHI (DAHI). Correlation statistics between the DAHI and
the conventionally scored AHI, in which hypopneas required ≥50% airflow reduction
alone or a lesser airflow reduction associated with ≥3% desaturation or arousal, 
using PSGs from APPLES were calculated.Results: A total of 833 adult subjects
were included. The DAHI has excellent and strong correlation with the
conventionally scored AHI on PSGs, with Pearson coefficients of 0.972 and
receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrating strong agreement in all
OSA categories: 98.5% in mild OSA (95% confidence interval [CI], 97.6-99.3%),
96.4% in moderate OSA (95% CI, 95.3-97.5%), and 98.5% in severe OSA (95% CI,
97.8-99.2%).Conclusions: An accurate automated AHI can be derived from oximetry
and CPC.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: There is significant literature on the development and
validation of quality measures, but comparably less on their implementation into 
learning health systems. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have made vast amounts 
of data available for quality improvement purposes. In this paper we describe a
conceptual model for EHR implementation of quality measures.
DESIGN: The model involves five steps: (1) select a measure; (2) define measure
criteria; (3) validate criteria and measurement process; (4) improve recording of
measure-related activity; and (5) engage quality improvement processes. The model
was used to develop and implement a quality measure in the Home-Based Medical
Care (HBMC) setting.
SETTING: Harris Health House Call Program (HHHC) provides primary medical and
palliative care for homebound patients in Houston.
PARTICIPANTS: Four-hundred twenty-four primary care patients followed in the
HHHC.
MEASUREMENT: Completion rate of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)
within the Electronic Health Record of newly enrolled HHHC patients.
RESULTS: Use of the conceptual model to guide implementation of a quality measure
of depression screening in a HMBC practice was successful. Additional components 
of early leadership and clinician buy-in were required, as well as strong
relationships with IT to ease implementation and limit disruptions in clinicians'
work-flow.
CONCLUSION: This conceptual model was feasible for guiding implementation of a
quality measure for depression care of HBMC patients, and it can guide broader
implementation of EHR-based quality measures in the future.

OBJECTIVE: Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a common,
costly, and hazardous healthcare-associated infection in children. In children in
whom continued access is critical, salvage of infected central venous catheters
(CVCs) with antimicrobial lock therapy is an alternative to removal and
replacement of the CVC. However, the success of CVC salvage is uncertain, and
when it fails the catheter has to be removed and replaced. We describe a machine 
learning approach to predict individual outcomes in CVC salvage that can aid the 
clinician in the decision to attempt salvage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 14-year period, 969 pediatric CLABSIs were
identified in electronic health records. We used 164 potential predictors to
derive 4 types of machine learning models to predict 2 failed salvage outcomes,
infection recurrence and CVC removal, at 10 time points between 7 days and 1 year
from infection onset.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve varied from
0.56 to 0.83, and key predictors varied over time. The infection recurrence model
performed better than the CVC removal model did.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning-based outcome prediction can inform clinical
decision making for children. We developed and evaluated several models to
predict clinically relevant outcomes in the context of CVC salvage in pediatric
CLABSI and illustrate the variability of predictors over time.

Extracting information from unstructured clinical text is a fundamental and
challenging task in medical informatics. Our study aims to construct a natural
language processing (NLP) workflow to extract information from Chinese electronic
dental records (EDRs) for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). We extracted
attributes, attribute values, and tooth positions based on an existing ontology
from EDRs. A workflow integrating deep learning with keywords was constructed, in
which vectors representing texts were unsupervised learned. Specifically, we
implemented Sentence2vec to learn sentence vectors and Word2vec to learn word
vectors. For attribute recognition, we calculated similarity values among
sentence vectors and extracted attributes based on our selection strategy. For
attribute value recognition, we expanded the keyword database by calculating
similarity values among word vectors to select keywords. Performance of our
workflow with the hybrid method was evaluated and compared with keyword-based
method and deep learning method. In both attribute and value recognition, the
hybrid method outperforms the other two methods in achieving high precision
(0.94, 0.94), recall (0.74, 0.82), and F score (0.83, 0.88). Our NLP workflow can
efficiently structure narrative text from EDRs, providing accurate input
information and a solid foundation for further data-based CDSSs.

BACKGROUND: The risks of misinformation on social networking sites is a global
issue, especially in light of the COVID-19 infodemic. WhatsApp is being used as
an important source of COVID-19-related information during the current pandemic. 
Unlike Facebook and Twitter, limited studies have investigated the role of
WhatsApp as a source of communication, information, or misinformation during
crisis situations.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to evaluate the vulnerability of demographic cohorts
in a developing country toward COVID-19-related misinformation shared via
WhatsApp. We also aimed to identify characteristics of WhatsApp messages
associated with increased credibility of misinformation.
METHODS: We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey and designed a scoring
system based on theories supported by the existing literature. Vulnerability (K) 
was measured as a ratio of the respondent's score to the maximum score.
Respondents were stratified according to age and occupation, and Kmean was
calculated and compared among each subgroup using single-factor analysis of
variance and Hochberg GT2 tests. The questionnaire evaluated the respondents'
opinion of the veracity of coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages. The responses
to the false-proven messages were compared using z test between the 2 groups:
coronavirus-related WhatsApp messages with an attached link and/or source and
those without.
RESULTS: We analyzed 1137 responses from WhatsApp users in India. Users aged over
65 years had the highest vulnerability (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.341-0.419) to
misinformation. Respondents in the age group 19-25 years had significantly lower 
vulnerability (Kmean=0.31, 95% CI 0.301-0.319) than those aged over 25 years
(P<.05). The vulnerability of users employed in elementary occupations was the
highest (Kmean=0.38, 95% CI 0.356-0.404), and it was significantly higher than
that of professionals and students (P<.05). Interestingly, the vulnerability of
healthcare workers was not significantly different from that of other occupation 
groups (P>.05). We found that false CRWMs with an attached link and/or source
were marked true 6 times more often than false CRWMs without an attached link or 
source (P<.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that in a developing country, WhatsApp users 
aged over 65 years and those involved in elementary occupations were found to be 
the most vulnerable to false information disseminated via WhatsApp. Health care
workers, who are otherwise considered as experts with regard to this global
health care crisis, also shared this vulnerability to misinformation with other
occupation groups. Our findings also indicated that the presence of an attached
link and/or source falsely validating an incorrect message adds significant false
credibility, making it appear true. These results indicate an emergent need to
address and rectify the current usage patterns of WhatsApp users. This study also
provides metrics that can be used by health care organizations and government
authorities of developing countries to formulate guidelines to contain the spread
of WhatsApp-related misinformation.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development 
and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely
understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns,
improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources.
Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself
ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of
optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy
recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites
will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic 
prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have
identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We
used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising
ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were
purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in
ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of
practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and
transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and
governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were 
suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for
this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical
informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the
ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource
supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing
process.

INTRODUCTION: Numerous scientific journal articles related to COVID-19 have been 
rapidly published, making navigation and understanding of relationships
difficult.
METHODS: A graph network was constructed from the publicly available COVID-19
Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) of COVID-19-related publications using an engine 
leveraging medical knowledge bases to identify discrete medical concepts and an
open-source tool (Gephi) to visualise the network.
RESULTS: The network shows connections between diseases, medications and
procedures identified from the title and abstract of 195 958 COVID-19-related
publications (CORD-19 Dataset). Connections between terms with few publications, 
those unconnected to the main network and those irrelevant were not displayed.
Nodes were coloured by knowledge base and the size of the node related to the
number of publications containing the term. The data set and visualisations were 
made publicly accessible via a webtool.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge management approaches (text mining and graph networks) can 
effectively allow rapid navigation and exploration of entity inter-relationships 
to improve understanding of diseases such as COVID-19.

Foreknowledge of the Fourth Semester Students about Medical Informatics at the
Medical Faculty University of Sarajevo.

Novo A(1), Pandza H(1).

Author information: 
(1)Faculty of Medicine, University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Introduction: High educational and teaching standards were the main reason why
from the begging student satisfaction surveys and assessments of the students'
knowledge, attitudes and opinions were paramount in the educational process at
the Cathedra for Medical Informatics at the Medical Faculty University of
Sarajevo.
Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate general knowledge of the fourth
semester students about informatics and medical informatics and compare it with
previous generations.
Methods: Students at the beginning of the fourth semester and before second
planned lectures receive "Questionnaire for biomedical students about use and
knowledge of information technologies". Collected data was retrospectively used
for this study. The scientific study committee of the Cathedra for Medical
Informatics reviewed and approved the database for using this study. At the
beginning of the survey, all students were informed that their data could be
tracked. Also, all students were informed and got lectures on surveys,
development and use of questionnaires for the examination of the patient/student 
satisfactions and how results of the survey and analysis could help continuously 
improving quality of the teaching process.
Discussion and Conclusion: Medical students come to the faculty with significant 
IT knowledge and skills. It can even be argued that students rank their knowledge
in some way lower than we as teachers estimate based on their practical work.
They organize groups on social networks where they exchange information about
lectures and exams. It is common for each study year to have its own group.
Through this group, information and presentations that teachers send to students 
are exchanged. One of the goals of teaching medical informatics is the method of 
searching for medical information on the Internet. The skills learned in medical 
informatics classes complement those learned earlier and provide a solid base for
physicians who are able to supplement their knowledge using IT technologies when 
they need it.

BACKGROUND: The imputation of missingness is a key step in Electronic Health
Records (EHR) mining, as it can significantly affect the conclusions derived from
the downstream analysis in translational medicine. The missingness of laboratory 
values in EHR is not at random, yet imputation techniques tend to disregard this 
key distinction. Consequently, the development of an adaptive imputation strategy
designed specifically for EHR is an important step in improving the data
imbalance and enhancing the predictive power of modeling tools for healthcare
applications.
METHOD: We analyzed the laboratory measures derived from Geisinger's EHR on
patients in three distinct cohorts-patients tested for Clostridioides difficile
(Cdiff) infection, patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
and patients with a diagnosis of hip or knee osteoarthritis (OA). We extracted
Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) from which we excluded
those with 75% or more missingness. The comorbidities, primary or secondary
diagnosis, as well as active problem lists, were also extracted. The adaptive
imputation strategy was designed based on a hybrid approach. The comorbidity
patterns of patients were transformed into latent patterns and then clustered.
Imputation was performed on a cluster of patients for each cohort independently
to show the generalizability of the method. The results were compared with
imputation applied to the complete dataset without incorporating the information 
from comorbidity patterns.
RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 67,445 patients (11,230 IBD patients, 10,000 OA
patients, and 46,215 patients tested for C. difficile infection). We extracted
495 LOINC and 11,230 diagnosis codes for the IBD cohort, 8160 diagnosis codes for
the Cdiff cohort, and 2042 diagnosis codes for the OA cohort based on the
primary/secondary diagnosis and active problem list in the EHR. Overall, the most
improvement from this strategy was observed when the laboratory measures had a
higher level of missingness. The best root mean square error (RMSE) difference
for each dataset was recorded as -35.5 for the Cdiff, -8.3 for the IBD, and -11.3
for the OA dataset.
CONCLUSIONS: An adaptive imputation strategy designed specifically for EHR that
uses complementary information from the clinical profile of the patient can be
used to improve the imputation of missing laboratory values, especially when
laboratory codes with high levels of missingness are included in the analysis.

BACKGROUND: Age and time information stored within the histories of clinical
notes can provide valuable insights for assessing a patient's disease risk,
understanding disease progression, and studying therapeutic outcomes. However,
details of age and temporally-specified clinical events are not well captured,
consistently codified, and readily available to research databases for study.
METHODS: We expanded upon existing annotation schemes to capture additional age
and temporal information, conducted an annotation study to validate our expanded 
schema, and developed a prototypical, rule-based Named Entity Recognizer to
extract our novel clinical named entities (NE). The annotation study was
conducted on 138 discharge summaries from the pre-annotated 2014 ShARe/CLEF
eHealth Challenge corpus. In addition to existing NE classes (TIMEX3,
SUBJECT_CLASS, DISEASE_DISORDER), our schema proposes 3 additional NEs (AGE,
PROCEDURE, OTHER_EVENTS). We also propose new attributes, e.g., "degree_relation"
which captures the degree of biological relation for subjects annotated under
SUBJECT_CLASS. As a proof of concept, we applied the schema to 49 H&P notes to
encode pertinent history information for a lung cancer cohort study.
RESULTS: An abundance of information was captured under the new OTHER_EVENTS,
PROCEDURE and AGE classes, with 23%, 10% and 8% of all annotated NEs belonging to
the above classes, respectively. We observed high inter-annotator agreement of
>80% for AGE and TIMEX3; the automated NLP system achieved F1 scores of 86% (AGE)
and 86% (TIMEX3). Age and temporally-specified mentions within past medical,
family, surgical, and social histories were common in our lung cancer data set;
annotation is ongoing to support this translational research study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our annotation schema and NLP system can encode historical events
from clinical notes to support clinical and translational research studies.

Hannover, Germany.

Introduction: In order to promote training and further education on topics
related to the digitization of medicine, the HiGHmeducation consortium is
developing online learning modules. These modules could also be offered across
locations. For students of human medicine, an elective for the acquisition of
data literacy has been implemented. Originally designed as a blended learning
offer, the elective was then carried out completely online due to the Covid-19
pandemic. Despite the lack of classroom teaching, the aim was to achieve
intensive cooperation between the students. Project description: In the elective,
the students worked on a total of 14 learning tasks, so-called e-tivities, which 
stimulate collaborative work and thus promote the examination of the learning
content. These asynchronous learning activities were supplemented by video
conferences, in which the students also took on the role of presenters. The
teachers accompanied this learning process as e-moderators. Results: In April/May
2020, the elective course was carried out with 12 students entirely online.
Despite a workload that was experienced as high, the elective was rated very well
by the students. Discussion: The didactic concept of the elective enabled an
active engagement with the learning material and the social interaction between
the learners. With the digital learning offers, the learners were able to gain
new experiences which are also of professional relevance. Conclusion: The
didactic concept of the elective can be transferred to other courses. Future
studies must show which long-term learning effects can be generated by digital
teaching based on teamwork, communication and exchange.

Publisher: Einleitung: Um die Aus- und Weiterbildung zu Themen rund um die
Digitalisierung der Medizin zu fördern, werden im Verbund HiGHmeducation
Online-Lernmodule entwickelt, die auch standortübergreifend angeboten werden
können. Für das Humanmedizinstudium wurde ein Wahlfach II für den Erwerb von
Datenkompetenzen umgesetzt, das ursprünglich als Blended Learning Angebot
konzipiert, während der Covid-19-Pandemie dann vollständig online durchgeführt
wurde. Trotz fehlender Präsenzlehre sollte dabei eine intensive Zusammenarbeit
der Studierenden erreicht werden.Projektbeschreibung: Im Wahlfach bearbeiteten
die Studierenden insgesamt 14 Lernaufgaben, sogenannte E-tivities, die eine
kollaborative Zusammenarbeit anregen und damit die Auseinandersetzung mit den
Lerninhalten fördern. Diese asynchronen Lernaktivitäten wurden durch
Videokonferenzen ergänzt, bei denen die Studierenden auch die Rolle der
Präsentierenden übernahmen. Die Lehrenden begleiteten als E-Moderator_innen
diesen Lernprozess.Ergebnisse: Im April/Mai 2020 wurde das Wahlfach mit 12
Studierenden vollständig online durchgeführt. Trotz einer als hoch erlebten
Arbeitsbelastung wurde das Wahlfach von den Studierenden sehr gut bewertet.
Diskussion: Eine aktive Auseinandersetzung mit dem Lernstoff und die soziale
Interaktion zwischen den Lernenden konnte mit dem didaktischen Konzept des
Wahlfachs erreicht werden. Durch das digitale Lernangebot konnten die Lernenden
neue Erfahrungen sammeln, die auch von beruflicher Relevanz sind.
Schlussfolgerung: Das didaktische Konzept des Wahlfachs lässt sich auf andere
Lehrveranstaltungen übertragen. Zukünftige Untersuchungen müssen zeigen, welche
längerfristigen Lerneffekte eine digitale Lehre, die auf Teamarbeit,
Kommunikation und Austausch setzt, generieren kann.

Deep learning methods have already enjoyed an unprecedented success in medical
imaging problems. Similar success has been evidenced when it comes to the
detection of COVID-19 from medical images, therefore deep learning approaches are
considered good candidates for detecting this disease, in collaboration with
radiologists and/or physicians. In this paper, we propose a new approach to
detect COVID-19 via exploiting a conditional generative adversarial network to
generate synthetic images for augmenting the limited amount of data available.
Additionally, we propose two deep learning models following a lightweight
architecture, commensurating with the overall amount of data available. Our
experiments focused on both binary classification for COVID-19 vs Normal cases
and multi-classification that includes a third class for bacterial pneumonia. Our
models achieved a competitive performance compared to other studies in literature
and also a ResNet8 model. Our best performing binary model achieved 98.7%
accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 98.3% specificity, while our three-class model
achieved 98.3% accuracy, 99.3% sensitivity and 98.1% specificity. Moreover, via
adopting a testing protocol proposed in literature, our models proved to be more 
robust and reliable in COVID-19 detection than a baseline ResNet8, making them
good candidates for detecting COVID-19 from posteroanterior chest X-ray images.

Background: Laboratory information systems are widely used health information
systems that have the potential to improve health care quality. Despite their
benefits, many studies have indicated problems with user interaction with these
systems due to poor interface design.
Aims: To evaluate the usability of a laboratory information system.
Methods: In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we used heuristic evaluation
to examine the user interface design of a laboratory information system in an
academic hospital affiliated with Kerman University of Medical Sciences in 2017. 
This system is also used in 59 other Iranian hospitals .We investigated the
usability of different parts of the usability of a laboratory information system 
(outpatient admission, inpatient admission, sample collection, and test result
reporting). Data were collected using a standard form based on the heuristic
evaluation method, and categorized based on their severity and violated
heuristics. The content validity was confirmed by 3 medical informatics
specialists.
Results: We identified 162 usability problems. In terms of the heuristics, the
highest number of problems concerned flexibility and efficiency of use (n = 32,
19.75%) and the lowest concerned help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from
errors (n = 2, 1.23%). In terms of different modules of the system, the highest
number of problems (n = 51, 31.48%) concerned outpatient admission and the lowest
(n = 29, 17.9%) concerned sample collection. In terms of severity, 45.06% of the 
problems were rated as major.
Conclusions: Despite widespread use of laboratory information systems, their user
interface design has usability problems that diminish the quality of user
interaction with these systems and may affect the quality of health care.
Consideration of standards and principles for user interface design, such as the 
heuristics used in this study, could improve system usability.

répandue des systèmes d’information de laboratoire, les interfaces présentent
souvent des problèmes d’utilisabilité qui diminuent la qualité de l’interaction
avec les utilisateurs et peuvent affecter la qualité des soins de santé offerts. 
Ainsi, au moment de concevoir les interfaces utilisateurs, il pourrait être utile
de s’appuyer sur des normes et des principes, à l’instar des heuristiques
utilisées dans cette étude. Cela pourrait en effet permettre d’améliorer la
convivialité des systèmes.

Introduction: We proposed to analyze the scientific production of our
institution, through the publications indexed in the PUBMED and analyze: a) Total
number of publications and progression over time; b) Type of publications; c)
Unit participation; d) Relation between % publications / % medical unit staff; e)
Impact factor.
Methods: A retrospective research was performed in PUBMED database between
1/1/2013 and 12/31/2018 and all the papers that respond to the affiliation name
of "Hospital Italiano" (spanish) o "Italian Hospital" (english) were reviewed.
The following information was collected from each publication: authors, journal, 
impact factor, unit involved and language of publication.
Results: A total of 1421 publications were included for the analysis. There was a
progressive increase of 417% between 2013 and 2018. 802 (56%) were done only by
our institution and 619 (44%) corresponded to multicenter studies. Internal
medicine (341 - 23.99%) was the unit with more publications and Medical
Informatics the unit with the best relation between % of publications and %
professional staff (5.39). 82% (1167) of the papers were in English and the
medina value of the impact factor was 2,61 (range: 0,01-29,78).
Conclusion: The scientific production, measurable by the number of publications
indexed in PUBMED has shown a progressive and sustained increase in time from
2013 to the present. We consider it important to stimulate and encourage
professionals to continue with scientific production without neglecting quality
standards of care activity.

BACKGROUND: The successful determination and analysis of phenotypes plays a key
role in the diagnostic process, the evaluation of risk factors and the
recruitment of participants for clinical and epidemiological studies. The
development of computable phenotype algorithms to solve these tasks is a
challenging problem, caused by various reasons. Firstly, the term 'phenotype' has
no generally agreed definition and its meaning depends on context. Secondly, the 
phenotypes are most commonly specified as non-computable descriptive documents.
Recent attempts have shown that ontologies are a suitable way to handle
phenotypes and that they can support clinical research and decision making. The
SMITH Consortium is dedicated to rapidly establish an integrative medical
informatics framework to provide physicians with the best available data and
knowledge and enable innovative use of healthcare data for research and treatment
optimisation. In the context of a methodological use case 'phenotype pipeline'
(PheP), a technology to automatically generate phenotype classifications and
annotations based on electronic health records (EHR) is developed. A large series
of phenotype algorithms will be implemented. This implies that for each algorithm
a classification scheme and its input variables have to be defined. Furthermore, 
a phenotype engine is required to evaluate and execute developed algorithms.
RESULTS: In this article, we present a Core Ontology of Phenotypes (COP) and the 
software Phenotype Manager (PhenoMan), which implements a novel ontology-based
method to model, classify and compute phenotypes from already available data. Our
solution includes an enhanced iterative reasoning process combining
classification tasks with mathematical calculations at runtime. The ontology as
well as the reasoning method were successfully evaluated with selected phenotypes
including SOFA score, socio-economic status, body surface area and WHO BMI
classification based on available medical data.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel ontology-based method to model phenotypes of
living beings with the aim of automated phenotype reasoning based on available
data. This new approach can be used in clinical context, e.g., for supporting the
diagnostic process, evaluating risk factors, and recruiting appropriate
participants for clinical and epidemiological studies.

Web-based imaging viewer for real-color volumetric reconstruction of human
visible project and DICOM datasets.

Borgbjerg J(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.

Anatomy remains a cornerstone of medical education. It is vital that students
achieve a robust understanding of the spatial relationships between anatomical
structures in three dimensions. Volumetric medical imaging studies and true-color
cryosectional three-dimensional images of visible human datasets are useful for
enhancing anatomy education. However, the software systems available for viewing 
these datasets have important limitations. A web-based application called
Mulrecon Color, which can overcome a number of those limitations, is introduced. 
Mulrecon Color enables volumetric medical and full color cryosectional datasets
to be explored without requiring installation, and can therefore be used on a
broad range of desktop, mobile, and even virtual reality devices. The web-based
application has an interface that resembles a DICOM viewer used in radiological
practice, and can be used both in anatomical labs and off campus for self-study. 
The Mulrecon Color application is released as an open source tool. It can be
retrieved at a project website where sample datasets are also available.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease, and much of 
our understanding stems from single-center studies, which are limited by sample
size and generalizability. Administrative data offer an appealing opportunity to 
inform clinical, research, and quality improvement efforts for PAH. Yet,
currently no standardized, validated method exists to distinguish PAH from other 
subgroups of pulmonary hypertension (PH) within this data source.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a collection of algorithms be developed and validated to
detect PAH in administrative data in two diverse settings: all Veterans Health
Administration (VA) hospitals and Boston Medical Center (BMC), a PAH referral
center.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In each setting, we identified all adult patients with 
incident PH from 2006 through 2017 using International Classification of Diseases
PH diagnosis codes. From this baseline cohort of all PH subgroups, we
sequentially applied the following criteria: diagnosis codes for PAH-associated
conditions, procedure codes for right heart catheterizations (RHCs), and pharmacy
claims for PAH-specific therapy. We then validated each algorithm using a gold
standard review of primary clinical data and calculated sensitivity, specificity,
positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive values.
RESULTS: From our baseline cohort, we identified 12,012 PH patients in all VA
hospitals and 503 patients in BMC. Sole use of PH diagnosis codes performed
poorly in identifying PAH (PPV, 16.0% in VA hospitals and 36.0% in BMC). The
addition of PAH-associated conditions to the algorithm modestly improved PPV. The
best performing algorithm required ICD diagnosis codes, RHC codes, and
PAH-specific therapy (VA hospitals: specificity, 97.1%; PPV, 70.0%; BMC:
specificity, 95.0%; PPV, 86.0%).
INTERPRETATION: This set of validated algorithms to identify PAH in
administrative data can be used by the PAH scientific and clinical community to
enhance the reliability and value of research findings, to inform quality
improvement initiatives, and ultimately to improve health for PAH patients.

OBJECTIVE: With the unprecedented rise of patient access to clinical
documentation through electronic health records, there is a need for health
systems to understand best practices for redesigning clinical documentation to
support patient needs. This study used an experience-based co-design approach to 
inform the redesign of cancer pathology reports to improve their
patient-centeredness and impact on patient engagement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple methods for data collection and stakeholder
engagement were used, including Delphi prioritisation with breast and colorectal 
cancer experts (n=78) and focus groups with patients with cancer (n=23) in the
Seattle area. Iterative rounds of consensus generation and reflection were used
to elicit themes and design recommendations for the development of
patient-centred pathology reports on cancer care.
RESULTS: Although each cancer type had nuanced elements to consider, common
design requirements emerged around two key themes: (1) clinical documentation
language should be framed in a way that informs and engages patients, and (2)
clinical documentation format should be leveraged to enhance readability and
information flow. Study activities illuminated detailed recommendations to
improve the patient-centeredness of pathology reports based on patients' and
clinicians' lived experience.
DISCUSSION: The design requirements that emerged from this study provide a
framework that can guide the rapid development of patient-centred pathology
reports for all cancer types. Even further, health systems can replicate these
methods to guide experience-based co-design of clinical documentation for
contexts beyond cancer care.
CONCLUSION: This work offers practice-based learnings that can more effectively
guide health systems in their clinical documentation redesign efforts.

BACKGROUND: Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS) of low-income countries
function below the globally expected standard, characterised by the production
and use of poor-quality data, or the non-use of good quality data for informed
decision making. This has negatively influenced the health service delivery and
uptake. This study focuses on identifying the factors associated with the
performance of RHIS of the health facilities (HF) in Yaoundé, so as to guide
targeted RHIS strengthening.
METHODS: A HF-based cross-sectional study in the 6 health districts (HDs) of
Yaoundé was conducted. HFs were chosen using stratified sampling with probability
proportional to size per HD. Data were collected, entered into Microsoft Excel
2013 and analysed with IBM- SPSS version 25. Consistency of the questionnaire was
measured using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Pearson's chi-square (and Fisher
exact where relevant) tests were used to establish relationships between
qualitative variables. Associations were further quantified using unadjusted Odd 
ratio (OR) for univariable analysis and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for
multivariable analysis with 95% confidence interval (CI). A p-value of less than 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Of 111 selected HFs; 16 (14.4%) were public and 95 (85.6%) private.
Respondents aged 24-60 years with an average of 38.3 ± 9.3 years; 58 (52.3%)
males and 53(47.7%) females. Cronbach's alpha was 0.96 (95%CI: 0.95-0.98,
p < 0.001), proving that the questionnaire was reliable in measuring RHIS
performances. At univariable level, the following factors were positively
associated with good performances: supportive supervision (OR = 3.03 (1.1, 8.3); 
p = 0.02), receiving feedback from hierarchy (OR = 3.6 (0.99, 13.2); p = 0.05),
having received training on health information (OR = 5.0 (1.6, 16.0); p = 0.003),
and presence of a performance evaluation plan (OR = 3.3 (1.4, 8.2), p = 0.007).
At multivariable level, the only significantly associated factor was having
received training on health information (aOR = 3.3 (1.01, 11.1), p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Training of health staff in the RHIS favors RHIS good performance.
Hence, emphasis should be laid on training and empowering staff, frequent and
regular RHIS supervision, and frequent and regular feedback, for an efficient
RHIS strengthening in Yaoundé.

Virtual care, the use of videoconferencing technology to connect with patients,
has become critical in providing continuing care for patients during the current 
COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual care has now been adopted by health care providers
across the spectrum, including physicians, residents, nurse practitioners,
nurses, and allied health care professionals. Virtual care is novel and nuanced
compared to in-person care. Most of the health care providers who are delivering 
or expected to deliver virtual care have little to no prior experience with it.
The nuances of virtual care involve regulatory standards, platforms, technology
and troubleshooting, patient selection, etiquette, and workflow, all of which
comprise critical points in the provision of health care. It is important to
consistently deliver high-quality, equitable, and professional virtual care to
inspire patients with the trust they need to continue follow-up of their care in 
these difficult times. We have been adopting virtual care in our clinical
practice for over two years. In partnership with Canada Health Infoway, we have
assembled a primer for virtual care that can serve as a guide for any health care
provider in Canada and globally, with the goal of providing seamless transitions 
between in-person and virtual care.

Brain monitors which track quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures to 
monitor sedation levels are drug and patient specific. There is a need for robust
sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all 
drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from
a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who
received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without
remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate 
the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using
leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning
models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil,
age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator 
characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction
model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models 
and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were
significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems
when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of
the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific.
Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately 
predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful 
reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction
systems using advanced machine learning algorithms. Clinical trial registration: 
NCT02043938 and NCT03143972.

It is the aim of the Medical Informatics Funding Scheme and other national and
local projects for digital networking in healthcare to facilitate the exchange
and use of patient data between institutions in compliance with data protection
regulations. This requires the integration of data from various sources-such as
digital workplace systems, laboratory systems, picture archiving and
communication (PAC) systems or tumor boards-into a data warehouse or research
databases. Digital networking of service providers and research institutions will
open access to high-performance and precision medicine (e.g., virtual molecular
tumor boards) for even more patients, thereby providing data for basic and care
research. Network medicine will establish the translational link between basic
research (e.g., genome research) and patient care. Digitally integrated "real
world" patient data will also facilitate a detailed analysis of health care and
the quality of treatments.

Publisher: Ziel der Medizininformatikinitiative und weiterer nationaler und
lokaler Projekte zur digitalen Vernetzung im Gesundheitswesen ist die
datenschutzkonforme Bereitstellung, der Austausch und die gemeinsame Nutzung von 
Patientendaten. Dies erfordert die Integration von Daten aus unterschiedlichen
Quellen – beispielsweise aus digitalen Arbeitsplatzsystemen, Laborsystemen,
PAC-Systemen („patient archieving and communication“) oder Tumorboards – in ein
Data Warehouse oder Forschungsdatenbanken. Die zunehmende digitale Vernetzung von
Leistungserbringern und Forschungseinrichtungen im Gesundheitswesen wird in
Zukunft noch mehr Patienten den Zugang zu Hochleistungs- und Präzisionsmedizin
(Stichwort virtuelle molekulare Tumorboards) öffnen und dabei Daten für
Grundlagen- und Versorgungsforschung liefern. Mit dieser Form der Netzwerkmedizin
schaffen wir einerseits die Verbindung von Grundlagen- (z. B. Genomforschung) und
Patientenversorgung, gleichermaßen kann mit den aufbereiteten Real-world-Daten
die Behandlungsrealität und -qualität im Sinne einer integrierten
Versorgungsforschung detailliert abgebildet werden.

The rise of evidence-based medicine, medical informatics, and genomics ---
together with growing enthusiasm for machine learning and other types of
algorithms to standardize medical decision-making --- has lent increasing
credibility to biomedical knowledge as a guide to the practice of medicine. At
the same time, concern over the lack of attention to the underlying assumptions
and unintended health consequences of such practices, particularly the widespread
use of race-based algorithms, from the simple to the complex, has caught the
attention of both physicians and social scientists. Epistemological debates over 
the meaning of "the social" and "the scientific" are consequential in discussions
of race and racism in medicine. In this paper, we examine the socio-scientific
processes by which one algorithm that "corrects" for kidney function in African
Americans became central to knowledge production about chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Correction factors are now used extensively and routinely in clinical
laboratories and medical practices throughout the US. Drawing on close textual
analysis of the biomedical literature, we use the theoretical frameworks of
science and technology studies to critically analyze the initial development of
the race-based algorithm, its uptake, and its normalization. We argue that race
correction of kidney function is a racialized biomedical practice that
contributes to the consolidation of a long-established hierarchy of difference in
medicine. Consequentially, correcting for race in the assessment of kidney
function masks the complexity of the lived experience of societal neglect that
damages health.

Under the 21st Century Cures Act and the Office of the National Coordinator for
Health Information Technology (ONC) rule implementing its interoperability
provisions, a patient's rights to easily request and obtain digital access to
portions of their medical records are now supported by both technology and
policy. Data, once directed by a patient to leave a Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act-covered health entity and enter a consumer app, will
usually fall under Federal Trade Commission oversight. Because the statutory
authority of the ONC does not extend to health data protection, there is not yet 
regulation to specifically address privacy protections for consumer apps. A
technologically feasible workflow that could be widely adopted and permissible
under ONC's rule, involves using the SMART on FHIR OAuth authorization routine to
present standardized information about app behavior. This approach would not bias
the patient in a way that triggers penalties under information blocking
provisions of the rule.

BACKGROUND: Common data models (CDMs) help standardize electronic health record
data and facilitate outcome analysis for observational and longitudinal research.
An analysis of pathology reports is required to establish fundamental information
infrastructure for data-driven colon cancer research. The Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) CDM is used in distributed research networks for
clinical data; however, it requires conversion of free text-based pathology
reports into the CDM's format. There are few use cases of representing cancer
data in CDM.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to construct a CDM database of colon
cancer-related pathology with natural language processing (NLP) for a research
platform that can utilize both clinical and omics data. The essential text
entities from the pathology reports are extracted, standardized, and converted to
the OMOP CDM format in order to utilize the pathology data in cancer research.
METHODS: We extracted clinical text entities, mapped them to the standard
concepts in the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics vocabularies, 
and built databases and defined relations for the CDM tables. Major clinical
entities were extracted through NLP on pathology reports of surgical specimens,
immunohistochemical studies, and molecular studies of colon cancer patients at a 
tertiary general hospital in South Korea. Items were extracted from each report
using regular expressions in Python. Unstructured data, such as text that does
not have a pattern, were handled with expert advice by adding regular expression 
rules. Our own dictionary was used for normalization and standardization to deal 
with biomarker and gene names and other ungrammatical expressions. The extracted 
clinical and genetic information was mapped to the Logical Observation
Identifiers Names and Codes databases and the Systematized Nomenclature of
Medicine (SNOMED) standard terminologies recommended by the OMOP CDM. The
database-table relationships were newly defined through SNOMED standard
terminology concepts. The standardized data were inserted into the CDM tables.
For evaluation, 100 reports were randomly selected and independently annotated by
a medical informatics expert and a nurse.
RESULTS: We examined and standardized 1848 immunohistochemical study reports,
3890 molecular study reports, and 12,352 pathology reports of surgical specimens 
(from 2017 to 2018). The constructed and updated database contained the following
extracted colorectal entities: (1) NOTE_NLP, (2) MEASUREMENT, (3)
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, (4) SPECIMEN, and (5) FACT_RELATIONSHIP of specimen with
condition and measurement.
CONCLUSIONS: This study aimed to prepare CDM data for a research platform to take
advantage of all omics clinical and patient data at Seoul National University
Bundang Hospital for colon cancer pathology. A more sophisticated preparation of 
the pathology data is needed for further research on cancer genomics, and various
types of text narratives are the next target for additional research on the use
of data in the CDM.

BACKGROUND: Considering morbidity, mortality, and annual treatment costs, the
dramatic rise in the incidence of sepsis and septic shock among intensive care
unit (ICU) admissions in US hospitals is an increasing concern. Recent changes in
the sepsis definition (sepsis-3), based on the quick Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (qSOFA), have motivated the international medical informatics research
community to investigate score recalculation and information retrieval, and to
study the intersection between sepsis-3 and the previous definition (sepsis-2)
based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) parameters.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was three-fold. First, we aimed to unpack 
the most prevalent criterion for sepsis (for both sepsis-3 and sepsis-2
predictors). Second, we intended to determine the most prevalent sepsis scenario 
in the ICU among 4 possible scenarios for qSOFA and 11 possible scenarios for
SIRS. Third, we investigated the multicollinearity or dichotomy among qSOFA and
SIRS predictors.
METHODS: This observational study was conducted according to the most recent
update of Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III, Version 1.4),
the critical care database developed by MIT. The qSOFA (sepsis-3) and SIRS
(sepsis-2) parameters were analyzed for patients admitted to critical care units 
from 2001 to 2012 in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA, USA) to
determine the prevalence and underlying relation between these parameters among
patients undergoing sepsis screening. We adopted a multiblind Delphi method to
seek a rationale for decisions in several stages of the research design regarding
handling missing data and outlier values, statistical imputations and biases, and
generalizability of the study.
RESULTS: Altered mental status in the Glasgow Coma Scale (59.28%, 38,854/65,545
observations) was the most prevalent sepsis-3 (qSOFA) criterion and the white
blood cell count (53.12%, 17,163/32,311 observations) was the most prevalent
sepsis-2 (SIRS) criterion confronted in the ICU. In addition, the two-factored
sepsis criterion of high respiratory rate (≥22 breaths/minute) and altered mental
status (28.19%, among four possible qSOFA scenarios besides no sepsis) was the
most prevalent sepsis-3 (qSOFA) scenario, and the three-factored sepsis criterion
of tachypnea, high heart rate, and high white blood cell count (12.32%, among 11 
possible scenarios besides no sepsis) was the most prevalent sepsis-2 (SIRS)
scenario in the ICU. Moreover, the absolute Pearson correlation coefficients were
not significant, thereby nullifying the likelihood of any linear correlation
among the critical parameters and assuring the lack of multicollinearity between 
the parameters. Although this further bolsters evidence for their dichotomy, the 
absence of multicollinearity cannot guarantee that two random variables are
statistically independent.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying the prevalence of the qSOFA criteria of sepsis-3 in
comparison with the SIRS criteria of sepsis-2, and understanding the underlying
dichotomy among these parameters provides significant inferences for sepsis
treatment initiatives in the ICU and informing hospital resource allocation.
These data-driven results further offer design implications for multiparameter
intelligent sepsis prediction in the ICU.

BACKGROUND: Patients and physicians engaging together in the electronic health
record (EHR) during clinical visits may provide opportunities to both improve
patient understanding and reduce medical errors.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential impact of a patient EHR display intervention
on patient quality and safety. We hypothesized that if patients had a dedicated
display with an explicit invitation to follow clinicians in the EHR that this
would identify several opportunities to engage patients in their care quality and
safety.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Physician-patient outpatient encounters (24 patients and 8 
physicians) were videotaped. Encounters took place in a hospital-based general
internal medicine outpatient clinic where physicians and patients had their
respective EHR monitors. Following the visits, each patient and physician was
interviewed for 30 min to understand their perception of the mirrored-screen
setting.
RESULTS: The following 7 themes were identified (a) curiosity, (b) opportunity to
ask questions, (c) error identification, (d) control over medications, (e)
awareness, (f) shared understanding & decision-making, (g) data privacy. These
themes collectively comprised a conceptual model for how patient engagement in
electronic health record use, through a dedicated second screen or an explicitly 
shared screen, relates to safety and quality opportunities. Therefore, the double
EHR screen provides an explicit invitation for patients to join the process to
influence safety.
CONCLUSION: Desired outcomes include real-time error identification and
better-shared understanding and decision-making, leading to better downstream
follow-through with care plans.

Capitated Telehealth Coaching Hospital Readmission Service in Australia:
Pragmatic Controlled Evaluation.

University, Clayton, Australia.

BACKGROUND: MonashWatch is a telehealth public hospital outreach pilot service as
a component of the Government of Victoria's statewide redesign initiative called 
HealthLinks: Chronic Care. Rather than only paying for hospitalizations,
projected funding is released earlier to hospitals to allow them to reduce
hospitalization costs. MonashWatch introduced a web-based app, Patient Journey
Record System, to assess the risk of the journeys of a cohort of patients
identified as frequent admitters. Telecare guides call patients using the Patient
Journey Record System to flag potential deterioration. Health coaches (nursing
and allied health staff) triage risk and adapt care for individuals.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was a pragmatic controlled evaluation of the impact of
MonashWatch on the primary outcome of bed days for acute nonsurgical admissions
in the intention-to-treat group versus the usual care group. The secondary
outcome was hospital admission rates. The net promoter score was used to gauge
satisfaction.
METHODS: Patients were recruited into an intention-to-treat group, which included
active telehealth and declined/lost/died groups, versus a systematically sampled 
(4:1) usual care group. A rolling sample of 250-300 active telehealth patients
was maintained from December 23, 2016 to June 23, 2019. The outcome-mean bed days
in intervention versus control-was adjusted using analysis of covariance for age,
gender, admission type, and effective days active in MonashWatch. Time-series
analysis tested for trends in change patterns.
RESULTS: MonashWatch recruited 1373 suitable patients who were allocated into the
groups: usual care (n=293) and intention-to-treat (n=1080; active telehealth:
471/1080, 43.6%; declined: 485, 44.9%; lost to follow-up: 178 /1080, 10.7%; died:
8/1080, 0.7%). Admission frequency of intention-to-treat compared to that of the 
usual care group did not significantly improve (P=.05), with a small number of
very frequent admitters in the intention-to-treat group. Age, MonashWatch
effective days active, and treatment group independently predicted bed days. The 
analysis of covariance demonstrated a reduction in bed days of 1.14 (P<.001) in
the intention-to-treat group compared with that in the usual care group, with
1236 bed days estimated savings. Both groups demonstrated regression-to-the-mean.
The downward trend in improved bed days was significantly greater (P<.001) in the
intention-to-treat group (Sen slope -406) than in the usual care group (Sen slope
-104). The net promoter score was 95% in the active telehealth group compared
with typical hospital scores of 77%.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinically and statistically meaningful reductions in acute hospital
bed days in the intention-to-treat group when compared to that of the usual care 
group were demonstrated (P<.001), although admission frequency was unchanged with
more short stay admissions in the intention-to-treat group. Nonrandomized control
selection was a limitation. Nonetheless, MonashWatch was successful in the
context of the HealthLinks: Chronic Care capitation initiative and is expanding.

United States.

BACKGROUND: Semantic textual similarity is a common task in the general English
domain to assess the degree to which the underlying semantics of 2 text segments 
are equivalent to each other. Clinical Semantic Textual Similarity (ClinicalSTS) 
is the semantic textual similarity task in the clinical domain that attempts to
measure the degree of semantic equivalence between 2 snippets of clinical text.
Due to the frequent use of templates in the Electronic Health Record system, a
large amount of redundant text exists in clinical notes, making ClinicalSTS
crucial for the secondary use of clinical text in downstream clinical natural
language processing applications, such as clinical text summarization, clinical
semantics extraction, and clinical information retrieval.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to release ClinicalSTS data sets and to motivate
natural language processing and biomedical informatics communities to tackle
semantic text similarity tasks in the clinical domain.
METHODS: We organized the first BioCreative/OHNLP ClinicalSTS shared task in 2018
by making available a real-world ClinicalSTS data set. We continued the shared
task in 2019 in collaboration with National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) and
the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium and organized the 
2019 n2c2/OHNLP ClinicalSTS track. We released a larger ClinicalSTS data set
comprising 1642 clinical sentence pairs, including 1068 pairs from the 2018
shared task and 1006 new pairs from 2 electronic health record systems, GE and
Epic. We released 80% (1642/2054) of the data to participating teams to develop
and fine-tune the semantic textual similarity systems and used the remaining 20% 
(412/2054) as blind testing to evaluate their systems. The workshop was held in
conjunction with the American Medical Informatics Association 2019 Annual
Symposium.
RESULTS: Of the 78 international teams that signed on to the n2c2/OHNLP
ClinicalSTS shared task, 33 produced a total of 87 valid system submissions. The 
top 3 systems were generated by IBM Research, the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, and the University of Florida, with Pearson
correlations of r=.9010, r=.8967, and r=.8864, respectively. Most top-performing 
systems used state-of-the-art neural language models, such as BERT and XLNet, and
state-of-the-art training schemas in deep learning, such as pretraining and
fine-tuning schema, and multitask learning. Overall, the participating systems
performed better on the Epic sentence pairs than on the GE sentence pairs,
despite a much larger portion of the training data being GE sentence pairs.
CONCLUSIONS: The 2019 n2c2/OHNLP ClinicalSTS shared task focused on computing
semantic similarity for clinical text sentences generated from clinical notes in 
the real world. It attracted a large number of international teams. The
ClinicalSTS shared task could continue to serve as a venue for researchers in
natural language processing and medical informatics communities to develop and
improve semantic textual similarity techniques for clinical text.

Identification of Adverse Drug Event-Related Japanese Articles: Natural Language 
Processing Analysis.

Ujiie S(1), Yada S(1), Wakamiya S(1), Aramaki E(1).

Author information: 
(1)Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan.

BACKGROUND: Medical articles covering adverse drug events (ADEs) are
systematically reported by pharmaceutical companies for drug safety information
purposes. Although policies governing reporting to regulatory bodies vary among
countries and regions, all medical article reporting may be categorized as
precision or recall based. Recall-based reporting, which is implemented in Japan,
requires the reporting of any possible ADE. Therefore, recall-based reporting can
introduce numerous false negatives or substantial amounts of noise, a problem
that is difficult to address using limited manual labor.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to develop an automated system that could identify
ADE-related medical articles, support recall-based reporting, and alleviate
manual labor in Japanese pharmaceutical companies.
METHODS: Using medical articles as input, our system based on natural language
processing applies document-level classification to extract articles containing
ADEs (replacing manual labor in the first screening) and sentence-level
classification to extract sentences within those articles that imply ADEs (thus
supporting experts in the second screening). We used 509 Japanese medical
articles annotated by a medical engineer to evaluate the performance of the
proposed system.
RESULTS: Document-level classification yielded an F1 of 0.903. Sentence-level
classification yielded an F1 of 0.413. These were averages of fivefold
cross-validations.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple automated system may alleviate the manual labor involved in
screening drug safety-related medical articles in pharmaceutical companies. After
improving the accuracy of the sentence-level classification by considering a
wider context, we intend to apply this system toward real-world postmarketing
surveillance.

AIM: To evaluate the influence of an algorithm designed to incorporate reflex
testing according to haemogram results for analytical tests ordered to
investigate anaemia.
METHODS: In 2020, a new request for 'initial study of anaemia' was created in
three primary care pilot centres for suspected anaemia or new anaemias. A
haemogram was ordered and the remainder of the tests were created in a reflex
manner according to an algorithm integrated in the laboratory information system 
that also generates a comment that is completed and validated by a haematologist.
The demand for tests was evaluated over three time periods.
RESULTS: Of 396 requests, anaemia was detected in 80 (20.2%), with 26 microcytic 
anaemias (6.57%), 20 iron deficiency anaemias, 41 (10.3%) normocytic anaemias and
13 macrocytic anaemias (3.28%); 4 with folate deficiency; and 1 haemolytic
anaemia. No haematological diseases were detected. Twenty-four (6.06%) cases
exhibited microcytosis/hypochromia without anaemia, 12 of which exhibited iron
deficiency. Four young women exhibiting within-limit haemoglobin levels had iron 
deficiency. There were 56 (14.1%) cases of macrocytosis without anaemia.With the 
new profile of 'initial study of anaemia', the demand for tests was reduced and
was significantly lower than in the remainder of primary centres for iron,
transferrin, ferritin, vitamin B12 and folate.
CONCLUSIONS: A new profile of 'initial study of anaemia' in the request form with
algorithms integrated in the laboratory information system enabled submission of 
orders and decreased the demand for unnecessary iron, transferrin, ferritin,
vitamin B12 and folate tests.

Metadata is often used for different tasks in the field of medical informatics:
semantic description of data, quality validation, data integration, or
information retrieval. Metadata definitions are captured and curated in
time-consuming tasks and stored in metadata repositories that manage and preserve
the metadata. Due to technical and legal restrictions, metadata is rarely as
easily accessible and interoperable as it is necessary for modern information
systems. In a previous study, a uniform interface based on the widely used
ISO/IEC 11179 and the Facebook data retrieval language GraphQL was introduced as 
a solution to these technical obstacles. In the meantime, the ISO standard 21526 
has been published, a recent version designed with a strong focus on health
informatics. While it is conceptually oriented on the metamodel in ISO 11179, a
number of extensions but also restructurings have been introduced. In this study,
the authors investigated the difference between ISO 11179 and ISO 21526 and
extended the unified metadata query interface to be future-proof and in
particular, to support the semantic extensions of ISO 21526.

This paper presents the early outcomes of the educational cooperation between two
European academic associations, namely the European Federation of Medical
Informatics (EFMI) and European Society of Emergency Medicine (EUSEM). Two
webinars were organized in December 2019 and June 2020 to explore areas where
mutual education would be beneficial for interdisciplinary cooperation to advance
the digitization of emergency departments for the benefit of patients, health
professionals and the health system as a whole. Preliminary findings from the
analysis of these two webinars are presented and the steps for further
cooperation are outlined.

OBJECTIVE: Qualitative methods are particularly well-suited to studying the
complexities and contingencies that emerge in the development, preparation, and
implementation of technological interventions in real-world clinical practice,
and much remains to be done to use these methods to their full advantage. We
aimed to analyze how qualitative methods have been used in health informatics
research, focusing on objectives, populations studied, data collection, analysis 
methods, and fields of analytical origin.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of original, qualitative empirical
research in JAMIA from its inception in 1994 to 2019. We queried PubMed to
identify relevant articles, ultimately including and extracting data from 158
articles.
RESULTS: The proportion of qualitative studies increased over time, constituting 
4.2% of articles published in JAMIA overall. Studies overwhelmingly used
interviews, observations, grounded theory, and thematic analysis. These articles 
used qualitative methods to analyze health informatics systems before, after, and
separate from deployment. Providers have typically been the main focus of
studies, but there has been an upward trend of articles focusing on healthcare
consumers.
DISCUSSION: While there has been a rich tradition of qualitative inquiry in
JAMIA, its scope has been limited when compared with the range of qualitative
methods used in other technology-oriented fields, such as human-computer
interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and science and technology
studies.
CONCLUSION: We recommend increased public funding for and adoption of a broader
variety of qualitative methods by scholars, practitioners, and policy makers and 
an expansion of the variety of participants studied. This should lead to systems 
that are more responsive to practical needs, improving usability, safety, and
outcomes.

The increasingly digitized healthcare system requires new skills from all those
involved. In order to impart these competencies, appropriate courses must be
developed at educational institutions. In view of the rapid development of new
aspects of digitization, this presents a challenge; suitable teaching formats
must be developed successively. The establishment of cross-location teaching
networks is one way to better meet training needs and to make the necessary
spectrum of educational content available. As part of the Medical Informatics
Initiative, the HiGHmed consortium is establishing such a teaching network, in
the field of medical informatics, which covers many topics related to the
digitization of the health care system. Various problem areas in the German
education system were identified that hinder the development of the teaching
network. These problem areas were prioritized firstly according to the urgency of
the solution from the point of view of the HiGHmed consortium and secondly
according to existing competencies in the participating societies. A workshop on 
the four most relevant topics was organized with experts from the German Society 
for Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS), the Society for
Medical Education (GMA) and the HiGHmed consortium. These are: recognition of
exam results from teaching modules that are offered digitally and across
locations, and their integration into existing curricula; recognition of digital,
cross-location teaching in the teachers' teaching load; nationwide uniform
competencies for teachers, in order to be able to conduct digital teaching
effectively and with comparable quality; technical infrastructure to efficiently 
and securely communicate and manage the recognition of exam results between
educational institutions. For all subject areas, existing preliminary work was
identified on the basis of working questions, and short- and long-term needs for 
action were formulated. Finally, a need for the redesign of a technologically
supported syntactic and semantic interoperability of learning performance
recording was identified.

Publisher: Das zunehmend digitalisierte Gesundheitswesen erfordert neue
Kompetenzen von allen Beteiligten. Um diese Kompetenzen vermitteln zu können,
müssen an den Bildungsinstitutionen entsprechende Lehrveranstaltungen entwickelt 
werden. Dies ist angesichts der rasanten Entwicklung neuer
Digitalisierungsaspekte eine Herausforderung; passende Lehrformate müssen
sukzessive aufgebaut werden. Die Etablierung standortübergreifender Lehrverbünde 
ist eine Möglichkeit, den Ausbildungsbedarf besser zu decken und die notwendige
Bandbreite an Bildungsinhalten verfügbar zu machen. Im Rahmen der
Medizininformatik-Initiative wird im HiGHmed-Konsortium ein solcher Lehrverbund
im Fachgebiet der Medizinischen Informatik aufgebaut, in welches viele Themen der
Digitalisierung des Gesundheitswesens fallen. Dabei wurden verschiedene
Problemfelder im deutschen Bildungswesen identifiziert, welche den Aufbau des
Lehrverbundes hemmen. Diese Problemfelder wurden unter Beachtung der
Dringlichkeit der Lösung aus Sicht des HiGHmeducation Konsortiums und
andererseits nach vorhandenen Kompetenzen in den teilnehmenden Fachgesellschaften
priorisiert. Zu den vier relevantesten Themen wurde ein Workshop mit Fachleuten
der deutschen Gesellschaft für Medizinische Informatik, Biometrie und
Epidemiologie (GMDS), der Gesellschaft für Medizinische Ausbildung (GMA) und des 
HiGHmed Konsortiums ausgerichtet. Diese sind:Anerkennung von Prüfungsleistungen
aus Lehrmodulen, welche digital und standortübergreifend angeboten werden, und
Integration in bestehende Curricula; Anerkennung digitaler,
standortübergreifender Lehre im Deputat der Lehrenden; bundesweit einheitliche
Kompetenzen für Lehrende, um digitale Lehre effektiv und mit vergleichbarer
Qualität betreiben zu können; technische Infrastrukturen, um die Anerkennung
zwischen Bildungseinrichtungen effizient und sicher kommunizieren und verwalten
zu können.Für alle Themengebiete wurden anhand von Arbeitsfragen existierende
Vorarbeiten identifiziert sowie kurz- und langfristige Handlungsbedarfe
formuliert. Abschließend wurde themenübergreifend ein Bedarf für die
Neugestaltung einer technologisch unterstützten syntaktischen und semantischen
Interoperabilität der Erfassung von Lernleistungen festgestellt.

BACKGROUND: Patient access to their medical records through patient portals (PPs)
facilitates information exchange and provision of quality health care.
Understanding factors that characterize patients with limited access to and use
of PPs is needed.
METHODS: Data were from the 2017-2018 Health Information National Trends Survey
5, Cycles 1 and 2, a nationally representative survey of US adults ≥ 18 years old
(n = 6789). Weighted multivariate logistic regressions modeled the associations
between patient characteristics and access to, facilitators of use, and use of
PPs and their functions.
RESULTS: Individuals without (vs with) a regular doctor (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR], 0.4; CI, 0.3-0.5) or health insurance (aOR, 0.4; CI, 0.2-0.7), those with 
high school (aOR 0.4; CI, 0.3-0.5) or with vocational/some college (aOR, 0.5; CI,
04.-0.7) education (vs college/postgraduate), or those with limited English
proficiency (vs those who speak English very well) (aOR, 0.7; CI, 0.5-0.9) were
less likely to report accessing their personal medical records. Women (vs men)
were more likely to report accessing their medical records (aOR, 1.5; CI,
1.2-1.8). Similar patterns were found for PPs access and facilitators of use.
Less consistent associations emerged between patient characteristics and use of
PP functionalities.
CONCLUSIONS: PP access and use are low. Having a primary care clinician,
patient's educational attainment, and being a woman were factors associated with 
PP access and use, but not race/ethnicity. Once access was achieved, use of PP
functionalities was generally uniform across demographic segments. Facilitating
PP access and use among all patient populations is warranted.

Key components and IT assistance of participant management in clinical research: 
a scoping review.

Pung J(1), Rienhoff O(1).

Author information:

Göttingen, Germany.

Objectives: Managing participants and their data are fundamental for the success 
of a clinical trial. Our review identifies and describes processes that deal with
management of trial participants and highlights information technology (IT)
assistance for clinical research in the context of participant management.
Methods: A scoping literature review design, based on the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement, was used to identify
literature on trial participant-related proceedings, work procedures, or
workflows, and assisting electronic systems.
Results: The literature search identified 1329 articles of which 111 were
included for analysis. Participant-related procedures were categorized into 4
major trial processes: recruitment, obtaining informed consent, managing
identities, and managing administrative data. Our results demonstrated that
management of trial participants is considered in nearly every step of clinical
trials, and that IT was successfully introduced to all participant-related areas 
of a clinical trial to facilitate processes.
Discussion: There is no precise definition of participant management, so a broad 
search strategy was necessary, resulting in a high number of articles that had to
be excluded. Nevertheless, this review provides a comprehensive overview of
participant management-related components, which was lacking so far. The review
contributes to a better understanding of how computer-assisted management of
participants in clinical trials is possible.

Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Objective: To identify recurrent themes, insights, and process recommendations
from stakeholders in US organizations during the health information technology
(HIT) modernization of an existing electronic health record (EHR) to a
commercial-off-the-shelf product in both resource-plentiful settings and in a
resource-constrained environment, the US Indian Health Service.
Materials and Methods: Thirteen qualitative interviews with stakeholders in
various organizations were conducted about HIT modernization efforts. Using a
Theory of Change framework, recurring themes were identified and analyzed.
Results: The interviewees emphasized the importance of organizational and process
revision during modernization, converting historical data, and clinical and
leadership involvement. HIT implementation required technological and
infrastructure redesign, additional training, and workflow reconfiguration.
Motivations for modernization included EHR usability dissatisfaction, revenue
enhancements, and improved clinical operations. Decision-making strategies,
primarily during HIT selection, included meetings with stakeholders. Successful
modernization resulted in improvements in clinical operations, patient
experience, and financial outlay.
Discussion: Existing implementation frameworks fail to provide experiential
feedback, such as implementation challenges, like data conversion, regulatory,
functionality, and interoperability requirements. Regardless of the healthcare
environment, HIT modernization requires the engagement of leadership and
end-users during HIT selection and through all stages of the implementation to
prepare people, processes, and technology. Organizations must iteratively define 
the technological, infrastructure, organizational, and workflow changes required 
for a successful HIT modernization effort.
Conclusions: HIT modernization is an opportunity for organizational and
technological change. Successful modernization requires a comprehensive,
intentional, well-communicated, and multidisciplinary approach.
Resource-constrained environments have the additional challenges of financial
burdens, limited staffing, and unstable infrastructure.

Background COVID-19 presented significant challenges to healthcare organisations,
which needed to rapidly remodel their services but were unable to allow staff to 
meet face to face to minimise infection risk. During this communication
predicament, National Health Service (NHS) Digital announced the provision of
Microsoft Teams, a digital communication and collaboration tool, which was
implemented at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust within 2 weeks.Method Given
the need to deploy at scale, rapidly and with minimal resource, an agile
decentralised innovation management approach was used, empowering staff to be
local implementors.Results Resulting use cases were highly original and varied,
ranging from a COVID-19 Education Programme to coordination of oxygen demand.
Analytics showed rapid and persistent adoption, surpassing 500 daily active users
within 11 days. Usage continues to increase, consistent with a direct network
effect.Conclusion These findings suggest a high demand for this format of
communication and high willingness to adopt it. Further qualitative research into
staff perceptions would be valuable to confirm this, and to assess the user
experience.Overall, this has been a radical approach to digital implementation in
healthcare, and has so far proved effective in delivering a cost minimal, rapid
communication tool at scale in the midst of a global pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Two-year longevity is a crucial consideration in revascularization
strategies for patients with symptomatic lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD).
However, factors associated with 2-year longevity and risk stratification in
octogenarians or nonagenarians have been underreported.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to investigate the associated variables and stratify
the 2-year prognosis in older patients with LEAD.
METHODS: We performed logistic regression and association rule mining based on
the Apriori algorithm to discover independent variables and validate their
associations with 2-year longevity. Malnutrition, inflammation, and stroke
factors were identified. C statistics and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to
assess the impact of different numbers of malnutrition, inflammation, and stroke 
factors on 2-year longevity.
RESULTS: We recruited a total of 232 octogenarians or nonagenarians (mean age 85 
years, SD 4.2 years) treated with endovascular therapy. During the study period, 
81 patients died, and 27 of those (33%) died from a cardiac origin within 2
years. Association rules analysis showed the interrelationships between 2-year
longevity and the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and nutritional status as
determined by the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score or Geriatric
Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI). The cut-off values of NLR, GNRI, and CONUT were
≥3.89, ≤90.3, and >3, respectively. The C statistics for the predictive power for
2-year longevity were similar between the CONUT score and the GNRI-based models
(0.773 vs 0.760; P=.57). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 2-year longevity
was worse as the number of malnutrition, inflammation, and stroke factors
increased from 0 to 3 in both the GNRI-based model (92% vs 68% vs 46% vs 12%,
respectively; P<.001) and the CONUT score model (87% vs 75% vs 49% vs 10%,
respectively; P<.001). The hazard ratio between those with 3 factors and those
without was 18.2 (95% CI 7.0-47.2; P<.001) in the GNRI and 13.6 (95% CI 5.9-31.5;
P<.001) in the CONUT score model.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the association and crucial role of
malnutrition, inflammation, and stroke factors in assessing 2-year longevity in
older patients with LEAD. Using this simple risk score might assist clinicians in
selecting the appropriate treatment.

Conflicting roles for humans in learning health systems and AI-enabled
healthcare.

Kasperbauer TJ(1).

Author information: 
(1)Indiana University Center for Bioethics, Indiana University School of
Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.

The goals of learning health systems (LHS) and of AI in medicine overlap in many 
respects. Both require significant improvements in data sharing and IT
infrastructure, aim to provide more personalized care for patients, and strive to
break down traditional barriers between research and care. However, the defining 
features of LHS and AI diverge when it comes to the people involved in medicine, 
both patients and providers. LHS aim to enhance physician-patient relationships
while developments in AI emphasize a physicianless experience. LHS also encourage
better coordination of specialists across the health system, but AI aims to
replace many specialists with technology and algorithms. This paper argues that
these points of conflict may require a reconsideration of the role of humans in
medical decision making. Although it is currently unclear to what extent machines
will replace humans in healthcare, the parallel development of LHS and AI raises 
important questions about the exact role for humans within AI-enabled healthcare.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to describe the contributions of clinical informatics
(CI) fellows to their institutions' coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a survey to capture key domains of health
informatics and perceptions regarding fellows' application of their CI skills. We
also conducted detailed interviews with select fellows and described their
specific projects in a brief case series.
RESULTS: Forty-one of the 99 CI fellows responded to our survey. Seventy-five
percent agreed that they were "able to apply clinical informatics training and
interest to the COVID-19 response." The most common project types were
telemedicine (63%), reporting and analytics (49%), and electronic health record
builds and governance (32%). Telehealth projects included training providers on
existing telehealth tools, building entirely new virtual clinics for video triage
of COVID-19 patients, and pioneering workflows and implementation of brand-new
emergency department and inpatient video visit types. Analytics projects included
reports and dashboards for institutional leadership, as well as developing
digital contact tracing tools. For electronic health record builds, fellows
directly contributed to note templates with embedded screening and testing
guidance, adding COVID-19 tests to order sets, and validating clinical triage
workflows.
DISCUSSION: Fellows were engaged in projects that span the breadth of the CI
specialty and were able to make system-wide contributions in line with their
educational milestones.
CONCLUSIONS: CI fellows contributed meaningfully and rapidly to their
institutions' response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal conditions are managed within primary care, but
patients can be referred to secondary care if a specialist opinion is required.
The ever-increasing demand for health care resources emphasizes the need to
streamline care pathways with the ultimate aim of ensuring that patients receive 
timely and optimal care. Information contained in referral letters underpins the 
referral decision-making process but is yet to be explored systematically for the
purposes of treatment prioritization for musculoskeletal conditions.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the feasibility of using natural language
processing and machine learning to automate the triage of patients with
musculoskeletal conditions by analyzing information from referral letters.
Specifically, we aim to determine whether referral letters can be automatically
assorted into latent topics that are clinically relevant, that is, considered
relevant when prescribing treatments. Here, clinical relevance is assessed by
posing 2 research questions. Can latent topics be used to automatically predict
treatment? Can clinicians interpret latent topics as cohorts of patients who
share common characteristics or experiences such as medical history,
demographics, and possible treatments?
METHODS: We used latent Dirichlet allocation to model each referral letter as a
finite mixture over an underlying set of topics and model each topic as an
infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. The topic model
was evaluated in the context of automating patient triage. Given a set of
treatment outcomes, a binary classifier was trained for each outcome using
previously extracted topics as the input features of the machine learning
algorithm. In addition, a qualitative evaluation was performed to assess the
human interpretability of topics.
RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of binary classifiers outperformed the
stratified random classifier by a large margin, indicating that topic modeling
could be used to predict the treatment, thus effectively supporting patient
triage. The qualitative evaluation confirmed the high clinical interpretability
of the topic model.
CONCLUSIONS: The results established the feasibility of using natural language
processing and machine learning to automate triage of patients with knee or hip
pain by analyzing information from their referral letters.

Implementation lessons: Establishing a shared 'hub-and-spoke,' web-based clinical
decision support system (CDSS) in an EHR shared by >600 community health centers 
incurred a myriad of challenges, which are summarized here to guide others
seeking to use similar CDSS. Legal and compliance challenges involved ensuring
secure data exchanges, determining which entity maintains data records, and
deciding which data are sent to the CDSS. Technical challenges involved using lab
data from multiple sources and improving the CDSS' cache routine performance in
its new setting. Clinical implementation challenges involved identifying optimal 
strategies for generating data on CDSS use rates, modifying the CDSS
functionality for obtaining clinician/staff feedback, and customizing the risk
thresholds that trigger the CDSS for the new setting.

BACKGROUND: The broad adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) provides great
opportunities to conduct health care research and solve various clinical problems
in medicine. With recent advances and success, methods based on machine learning 
and deep learning have become increasingly popular in medical informatics.
However, while many research studies utilize temporal structured data on
predictive modeling, they typically neglect potentially valuable information in
unstructured clinical notes. Integrating heterogeneous data types across EHRs
through deep learning techniques may help improve the performance of prediction
models.
METHODS: In this research, we proposed 2 general-purpose multi-modal neural
network architectures to enhance patient representation learning by combining
sequential unstructured notes with structured data. The proposed fusion models
leverage document embeddings for the representation of long clinical note
documents and either convolutional neural network or long short-term memory
networks to model the sequential clinical notes and temporal signals, and one-hot
encoding for static information representation. The concatenated representation
is the final patient representation which is used to make predictions.
RESULTS: We evaluate the performance of proposed models on 3 risk prediction
tasks (i.e. in-hospital mortality, 30-day hospital readmission, and long length
of stay prediction) using derived data from the publicly available Medical
Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset. Our results show that by
combining unstructured clinical notes with structured data, the proposed models
outperform other models that utilize either unstructured notes or structured data
only.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed fusion models learn better patient representation by
combining structured and unstructured data. Integrating heterogeneous data types 
across EHRs helps improve the performance of prediction models and reduce errors.

OBJECTIVE: Human trafficking is a global problem taking many forms, including sex
and labor exploitation. Trafficking victims can be any age, although most
trafficking begins when victims are adolescents. Many trafficking victims have
contact with health-care providers across various health-care contexts, both for 
emergency and routine care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We propose 4 specific areas where medical informatics can 
assist with combatting trafficking: screening, clinical decision support,
community-facing tools, and analytics that are both descriptive and predictive.
Efforts to implement health information technology interventions focused on
trafficking must be carefully integrated into existing clinical work and
connected to community resources to move beyond identification to provide
assistance and to support trauma-informed care.
RESULTS: We lay forth a research and implementation agenda to integrate human
trafficking identification and intervention into routine clinical practice,
supported by health information technology.
CONCLUSIONS: A sociotechnical systems approach is recommended to ensure
interventions address the complex issues involved in assisting victims of human
trafficking.

Predictive Models for Neonatal Follow-Up Serum Bilirubin: Model Development and
Validation.

Chou JH(1).

Author information: 
(1)Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States.

BACKGROUND: Hyperbilirubinemia affects many newborn infants and, if not treated
appropriately, can lead to irreversible brain injury.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop predictive models of follow-up total serum 
bilirubin measurement and to compare their accuracy with that of clinician
predictions.
METHODS: Subjects were patients born between June 2015 and June 2019 at 4
hospitals in Massachusetts. The prediction target was a follow-up total serum
bilirubin measurement obtained <72 hours after a previous measurement. Birth
before versus after February 2019 was used to generate a training set (27,428
target measurements) and a held-out test set (3320 measurements), respectively.
Multiple supervised learning models were trained. To further assess model
performance, predictions on the held-out test set were also compared with
corresponding predictions from clinicians.
RESULTS: The best predictive accuracy on the held-out test set was obtained with 
the multilayer perceptron (ie, neural network, mean absolute error [MAE] 1.05
mg/dL) and Xgboost (MAE 1.04 mg/dL) models. A limited number of predictors were
sufficient for constructing models with the best performance and avoiding
overfitting: current bilirubin measurement, last rate of rise, proportion of time
under phototherapy, time to next measurement, gestational age at birth, current
age, and fractional weight change from birth. Clinicians made a total of 210
prospective predictions. The neural network model accuracy on this subset of
predictions had an MAE of 1.06 mg/dL compared with clinician predictions with an 
MAE of 1.38 mg/dL (P<.0001). In babies born at 35 weeks of gestation or later,
this approach was also applied to predict the binary outcome of subsequently
exceeding consensus guidelines for phototherapy initiation and achieved an area
under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.97).
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed predictive models for neonatal follow-up total 
serum bilirubin measurements that outperform clinicians. This may be the first
report of models that predict specific bilirubin values, are not limited to
near-term patients without risk factors, and take into account the effect of
phototherapy.

The implementation of entrepreneurship and innovation within the health
informatics scientific community is comparatively sluggish when compared to other
disciplines such as computer science and engineering. The purpose of this paper
is to explore the cognitive processes involved in developing intentions to
endorse entrepreneurial behaviors via discovering entrepreneurial awareness as a 
significant influence on an individual's intentions to identify and adventure
market opportunities. In this conceptual paper, insights from Ajzen's Theory of
Planning Behavior (TPB) coupled with self-efficacy beliefs are utilized to
develop hypotheses from our research questions. TPB has often been applied to
entrepreneurial studies, but for the voluminous body of research devoted to
intentions, little has delved into the cognitive processes whereby people develop
intentions to entrepreneurial behaviors. Thus, our extended framework can better 
understand the factors behind entrepreneurial intentions. This research uses a
survey tool as a structured questionnaire to explore students' perceptions of
entrepreneurial behavior. The source of the questionnaire is to survey many
students from different types of universities in Taiwan. This method allowed
respondents to clarify and pose questions. Of the 154 web questionnaires
distributed till end of June, 120 were returned, constituting a response rate of 
77.9% and Common Method Variance (CMV) had checked. Our results suggest that
measuring self-efficacy beliefs in tandem with attitudes toward entrepreneurship 
provides a better analytical model based on the TPB. The R-Square is 41.2% for
full model. Moreover, the results help understand entrepreneurial intentions
specifically applied to the medical informatics (MI) field which has been under
researched. Finally, this study also can guide educators in their efforts to
reinforce entrepreneurial behaviors in entrepreneurship education, for example,
awareness creation or attractiveness.

BACKGROUND: Creating an ontology for COVID-19 surveillance should help ensure
transparency and consistency. Ontologies formalize conceptualizations at either
the domain or application level. Application ontologies cross domains and are
specified through testable use cases. Our use case was an extension of the role
of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and
Surveillance Centre (RSC) to monitor the current pandemic and become an
in-pandemic research platform.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop an application ontology for COVID-19 that 
can be deployed across the various use-case domains of the RCGP RSC research and 
surveillance activities.
METHODS: We described our domain-specific use case. The actor was the RCGP RSC
sentinel network, the system was the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
outcomes were the spread and effect of mitigation measures. We used our
established 3-step method to develop the ontology, separating ontological concept
development from code mapping and data extract validation. We developed a coding 
system-independent COVID-19 case identification algorithm. As there were no
gold-standard pandemic surveillance ontologies, we conducted a rapid Delphi
consensus exercise through the International Medical Informatics Association
Primary Health Care Informatics working group and extended networks.
RESULTS: Our use-case domains included primary care, public health, virology,
clinical research, and clinical informatics. Our ontology supported (1) case
identification, microbiological sampling, and health outcomes at an individual
practice and at the national level; (2) feedback through a dashboard; (3) a
national observatory; (4) regular updates for Public Health England; and (5)
transformation of a sentinel network into a trial platform. We have identified a 
total of 19,115 people with a definite COVID-19 status, 5226 probable cases, and 
74,293 people with possible COVID-19, within the RCGP RSC network (N=5,370,225).
CONCLUSIONS: The underpinning structure of our ontological approach has coped
with multiple clinical coding challenges. At a time when there is uncertainty
about international comparisons, clarity about the basis on which case
definitions and outcomes are made from routine data is essential.

(#)Contributed equally

BACKGROUND: Although both disaster management and disaster medicine have been
used for decades, their efficiency and effectiveness have been far from perfect. 
One reason could be the lack of systematic utilization of modern technologies,
such as eHealth, in their operations. To address this issue, researchers' efforts
have led to the emergence of the disaster eHealth (DEH) field. DEH's main
objective is to systematically integrate eHealth technologies for health care
purposes within the disaster management cycle (DMC).
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify, map, and define the scope of DEH as a new
area of research at the intersection of disaster management, emergency medicine, 
and eHealth.
METHODS: An extensive scoping review using published materials was carried out in
the areas of disaster management, disaster medicine, and eHealth to identify the 
scope of DEH. This review procedure was iterative and conducted in multiple
scientific databases in 2 rounds, one using controlled indexed terms and the
other using similar uncontrolled terms. In both rounds, the publications ranged
from 1990 to 2016, and all the appropriate research studies discovered were
considered, regardless of their research design, methodology, and quality.
Information extracted from both rounds was thematically analyzed to define the
DEH scope, and the results were evaluated by the field experts through a Delphi
method.
RESULTS: In both rounds of the research, searching for eHealth applications
within DMC yielded 404 relevant studies that showed eHealth applications in
different disaster types and disaster phases. These applications varied with
respect to the eHealth technology types, functions, services, and stakeholders.
The results led to the identification of the scope of DEH, including eHealth
technologies and their applications, services, and future developments that are
applicable to disasters as well as to related stakeholders. Reference to the
elements of the DEH scope indicates what, when, and how current eHealth
technologies can be used in the DMC.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive data gathering from multiple databases offered a
grounded method to define the DEH scope. This scope comprises concepts related to
DEH and the boundaries that define it. The scope identifies the eHealth
technologies relevant to DEH and the functions and services that can be provided 
by these technologies. In addition, the scope tells us which groups can use the
provided services and functions and in which disaster types or phases. DEH
approaches could potentially improve the response to health care demands before, 
during, and after disasters. DEH takes advantage of eHealth technologies to
facilitate DMC tasks and activities, enhance their efficiency and effectiveness, 
and enhance health care delivery and provide more quality health care services to
the wider population regardless of their geographical location or even disaster
types and phases.

Health-related virtual reality (VR) applications for patient treatment,
rehabilitation, and medical professional training are on the rise. However, there
is little guidance on how to select and perform usability evaluations for VR
health interventions compared to the supports that exist for other digital health
technologies. The purpose of this viewpoint paper is to present an introductory
summary of various usability testing approaches or methods that can be used for
VR applications. Along with an overview of each, a list of resources is provided 
for readers to obtain additionally relevant information. Six categories of VR
usability evaluations are described using a previously developed classification
taxonomy specific to VR environments: (1) cognitive or task walkthrough, (2)
graphical evaluation, (3) post hoc questionnaires or interviews, (4) physical
performance evaluation, (5) user interface evaluation, and (6) heuristic
evaluation. Given the growth of VR in health care, rigorous evaluation and
usability testing is crucial in the development and implementation of novel VR
interventions. The approaches outlined in this paper provide a starting point for
conducting usability assessments for health-related VR applications; however,
there is a need to also move beyond these to adopt those from the gaming
industry, where assessments for both usability and user experience are routinely 
conducted.

Electronic health and medical records are widely adopted in many healthcare
settings worldwide to improve the quality of care. Users' perception is a
significant factor influencing the successful implementation and use of e-health 
technologies. This systematic review aimed to identify factors influencing the
perceptions of healthcare professionals towards the adoption and use of
electronic health and medical record systems to improve the quality of healthcare
services in the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. We identified primary 
studies evaluating healthcare professionals' perception towards electronic health
records and/or electronic medical records in the Gulf region. Seven electronic
databases, including Medline, CINAHL, Informit Health Collection, Science Direct,
ProQuest, PubMed, and Scopus were used to search for the relevant articles
published between January 2007 and December 2016. Thirteen articles met the
inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Both individual
and system-related factors were found to positively or negatively influence
healthcare providers' perceptions towards the systems. Understanding the impact
of healthcare professionals' perception of health information technology is
important for policymakers involved in the implementation programs to ensure
their success. Future studies should evaluate other individual characteristics
such as age, gender, and profession of the healthcare providers on their
perceptions towards e-health technologies.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) allow for the direct measurement of 
functional and psychosocial effects related to treatment. However, technological 
barriers, survey fatigue, and clinician adoption have hindered the meaningful
integration of PROs into clinical care. The objective of the authors was to
develop an electronic PROs (ePROs) program that meets a range of clinical needs
across a head and neck multidisciplinary disease management team.
METHODS: The authors developed the ePROs module using literature review and
stakeholder input in collaboration with health informatics. They designed an
ePROs platform that was integrated as the standard of care for personalized
survey delivery by diagnosis across the disease management team. Tableau software
was used to create dashboards for data visualization and monitoring at the
clinical enterprise, disease subsite, and patient levels. All patients who were
treated for head and neck cancer were eligible for ePROs assessment as part of
the standard of care. A descriptive analysis of ePROs program implementation is
presented herein.
RESULTS: The Head and Neck Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has 
integrated ePROs into clinical care. Surveys are delivered via the patient portal
at the time of diagnosis and longitudinally through care. From August 1, 2018, to
February 1, 2020, a total of 4154 patients completed ePROs surveys. The average
patient participation rate was 69%, with a median time for completion of 5
minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: Integration of the head and neck ePROs program as part of clinical
care is feasible and could be used to assess value and counsel patients in the
future. Continued qualitative assessments of stakeholders and workflow will
refine content and enhance the health informatics platform.
LAY SUMMARY: Patients with head and neck cancer experience significant changes in
their quality of life after treatment. Measuring and integrating patient-reported
outcomes as a part of clinical care have been challenging given the multimodal
treatment options, vast subsites, and unique domains affected. The authors
present a case study of the successful integration of electronic patient-reported
outcomes into a high-volume head and neck cancer practice.

OBJECTIVES: Health apps are software programs that are designed to prevent,
diagnose, monitor, or manage conditions. Inconsistent terminology for apps is
used in research literature and bibliographic database subject headings. It can
therefore be challenging to retrieve evidence about them in literature searches. 
Information specialists at the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) have developed novel validated search filters to retrieve 
evidence about apps from MEDLINE and Embase (Ovid).
METHODS: A selection of medical informatics journals was hand searched to
identify a "gold standard" (GS) set of references about apps. The GS set was
divided into a development and validation set. The filters' search terms were
derived from and tested against the development set. An external development set 
containing app references from published NICE products was also used to inform
the development of the filters. The filters were then validated using the
validation set. Target recall was >90 percent. The filters' overall recall,
specificity, and precision were calculated using all the references identified
from the hand search.
RESULTS: Both filters achieved 98.6 percent recall against their validation sets.
Overall, the MEDLINE filter had 98.8 percent recall, 71.3 percent specificity,
and 22.6 percent precision. The Embase filter had 98.6 percent recall, 74.9
percent specificity, and 24.5 percent precision.
CONCLUSIONS: The NICE health apps search filters retrieve evidence about apps
from MEDLINE and Embase with high recall. They can be applied to literature
searches to retrieve evidence about the interventions by information
professionals, researchers, and clinicians.

BACKGROUND: Recent research has led to the development of many information
technology-supported systems for health care control, including systems
estimating nutrition from images of meals. Systems that capture data about eating
and exercise are useful for people with diabetes as well as for people who are
simply on a diet. Continuous monitoring is key to effective dietary control,
requiring systems that are simple to use and motivate users to pay attention to
their meals. Unfortunately, most current systems are complex or fail to motivate.
Such systems require some manual inputs such as selection of an icon or image, or
by inputting the category of the user's food. The nutrition information fed back 
to users is not especially helpful, as only the estimated detailed nutritional
values contained in the meal are typically provided.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we introduce healthiness of meals as a more useful and 
meaningful general standard, and present a novel algorithm that can estimate
healthiness from meal images without requiring manual inputs.
METHODS: We propose a system that estimates meal healthiness using a deep neural 
network that extracts features and a ranking network that learns the relationship
between the degrees of healthiness of a meal using a dataset prepared by a human 
dietary expert. First, we examined whether a registered dietitian can judge the
healthiness of meals solely by viewing meal images using a small dataset (100
meals). We then generated ranking data based on comparisons of sets of meal
images (850 meals) by a registered dietitian's viewing meal images and trained a 
ranking network. Finally, we estimated each meal's healthiness score to detect
unhealthy meals.
RESULTS: The ranking estimated by the proposed network and the ranking of
healthiness based on the dietitian's judgment were correlated (correlation
coefficient 0.72). In addition, extracting network features through pretraining
with a publicly available large meal dataset enabled overcoming the limited
availability of specific healthiness data.
CONCLUSIONS: We have presented an image-based system that can rank meals in terms
of the overall healthiness of the dishes constituting the meal. The ranking
obtained by the proposed method showed a good correlation to nutritional
value-based ranking by a dietitian. We then proposed a network that allows
conditions that are important for judging the meal image, extracting features
that eliminate background information and are independent of location. Under
these conditions, the experimental results showed that our network achieves
higher accuracy of healthiness ranking estimation than the conventional image
ranking method. The results of this experiment in detecting unhealthy meals
suggest that our system can be used to assist health care workers in establishing
meal plans for patients with diabetes who need advice in choosing healthy meals.

Objective: We focused on medical informatics journal publications rather than on 
conference proceedings by comparing and analyzing the data from journals and
conferences from a broader perspective. The aim is to summarize the unique
contributions of China to medical digitization and foster more multilevel
international cooperation.
Method: In February 2019, publications from 2008 to 2018 in three major
English-language medical informatics journals were retrieved through Scopus,
including the journals, namely, International Journal of Medical Informatics
(IJMI, international community), JAMIA (United States), and Methods of
Information in Medicine (MIM, Europe). Three major Chinese-language journals,
namely, China Digital Medicine (CDM), Chinese Journal of Health Informatics and
Management (CJHIM), and Chinese Journal of Medical Library and Information
Science (CJMLIS), were searched within the major three Chinese literature
databases. The datasets were preprocessed using the NLP package on Python, and a 
smart local moving algorithm was used as a clustering method for identifying the 
aforementioned journals.
Result: Between 2008 and 2018, the total number of published papers and H-index
of the three English-language journals was 1371 and 67 (IJMI), 1752 and 86
(JAMIA), and 637 and 35 (MIM), respectively. In the same period, the total number
of published papers and H-index in the three Chinese-language journals was 6668
and 23 (CDM), 1668 and 22 (CJHIM), and 2557 and 25 (CJMLIS), respectively. IJMI, 
JAMIA, and MIM received submissions from 82, 59, and 62 countries/regions,
respectively. By contrast, the three Chinese journals only received submissions
from seven foreign countries. The proportions of authors from institutional
affiliations were similar between the three English-language journals (IJMI,
JAMIA, and MIM) and CJMLIS because the majority of the authors were from
universities (81%, 74%, 73%, and 65.2%), followed by medical institutions (12%,
10%, 9%, and 23.4%) or research institutes (2%, 4%, 10%, and 4.3%). Furthermore, 
the proportions of the authors from enterprises were low (2%, 6%, 4%, and 0.3%)
for all journals. However, the authors in CDM and CJHIM were mainly from medical 
institutions (50% and 40%), followed by universities (33% and 32%) and research
institutes (3% and 4%). In addition, the proportions of enterprises were only 3% 
and 2%, respectively. Among the top five authors in three English-language
journals (ranked in terms of the number of published papers), 100% had doctoral
or master's degrees, compared with only 60% in the Chinese journals.
Additionally, 28204 different keywords were extracted from the aforementioned
papers, covering 275 specific high-frequency key terms. Based on these key terms,
four clusters were found in the English literature-"Health and Clinical
Information Systems," "Internet and Telemedicine," "Medical Data Statistical
Analysis," and "EHRs and Information Management"-and three clusters were found in
the Chinese literature: "Hospital Information Systems and EMR," "Library Science 
and Bibliometrics Analysis," and "Medical Reform Policy and Health Digitization."
Only two clusters are similar, and Chinese-language journals focus more on health
information in technology and industrial applications than in medical informatics
basic research.
Conclusion: This study provides important insights into the development of
medical informatics (MI) in China and Western countries showing that the medical 
informatics journals of China, the United States, and Europe have distinct
characteristics. Specifically, first, compared with the Western journals, the
number of papers published in the journals of professional associations in the
field of MI in China is large and the application value is high, but the academic
influence and academic value are relatively low; second, most of the authors of
the Chinese papers are from hospitals, and most of the counterparts in the
Western countries are from universities. The proportion of master's or doctoral
degrees in the former is also lower than that of the latter; furthermore,
regarding paper themes, on the one hand, China MI has no theoretical and basic
research on medical data statistics and consumer health based on the Internet and
telemedicine; on the other hand, after nearly 10 years of hospital digital
development, China has fully used the latecomer and application advantages in
hospitals and, through extensive international cooperation, has made significant 
advancements in and contributions to the development of medical information.

BACKGROUND: Reducing the harms associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) requires
addressing a wide range of patient safety issues, including polypharmacy and
transitions of care, particularly for vulnerable patient groups. Computerised
audit and feedback can transform the way healthcare organisations measure,
analyse and learn from quality and safety data across different care settings,
potentially improving patient safety.
OBJECTIVE: To implement and evaluate an audit and feedback dashboard targeting
AKI to improve patient safety, focusing on factors affecting a range of user
characteristics in primary care.
METHODS: We performed a mixed methods study in three stages. Semi-structured
interviews were initially performed with both primary (n = 10) and secondary care
(n = 5) staff to gather user requirements for six quality indicators extracted
from national guidance on post-discharge AKI care. Modified indicators were
implemented in the Performance Improvement plaN GeneratoR (PINGR) audit and
feedback dashboard for six months, across 45 general practices in Salford.
Primary care professionals were then interviewed again (n = 7) and completed
usability questionnaires. This was triangulated with an interrupted time series
analysis on indicator performance, alongside software usage statistics.
RESULTS: Improvements were observed for the indicators for medication review
(+9.01 %; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI), +6.95 % to +11.06 %) and blood pressure 
measurement (+5.20 %; 95 % CI + 3.61 % to +6.78 %). Variable performance and
engagement were observed for other indicators including AKI coding (+0.39 %; 95 %
CI -1.88 % to +2.65 %), serum creatinine (-3.40 %; 95 % CI -7.66 % to +0.85 %),
proteinuria (-1.08 %; 95 % CI -1.47 % to +0.32 %) and providing patient
information (+0.16 %; 95 % CI -0.41 % to +0.73 %). A key facilitator to
engagement was the development of 'champions of change', achieved through a
raised awareness of high-risk patients, guidelines, inconsistencies in coding
practice and evidence for quality and safety performance. Barriers related to the
specificity and perceived achievability of indicators, and limitations in
resources.
CONCLUSION: In a six-month, quasi-experimental evaluation of an electronic audit 
and feedback dashboard targeting AKI, we found improvements for two out of six
quality indicators. While information technology can facilitate improvements in
patient safety, further allocation of protected staff time and investment into
shared learning are needed to realise those improvements in practice.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia which is a
major risk factor for stroke, transient ischaemic attacks and increased
mortality. Primary care management of AF can significantly reduce these risks. We
carried out an evaluation to asses the usability of an AF dashboard developed to 
improve data quality and the quality of care.
METHOD: We developed an online dashboard about the quality of AF management for
general practices of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners Research
and Surveillance Centre network. The dashboard displays (1) case ascertainment,
(2) a calculation of stroke and haemorrhage risk to assess whether the benefits
of anticogulants outweigh their risk, (3) prescriptions of different types of
anticoagulant and (4) if prescribed anticoagulant is at the correct dose. We
conducted the think aloud evaluation, involving 24 dashboard users to improve its
usability.
RESULTS: Analysis of 24 transcripts received produced 120 individual feedback
items (ie, verbalised tasks) that were mapped across five usability problem
classes. We enhanced the dashboard based on evaluation feedback to encourage
adoption by general practices participating in the sentinel network.
CONCLUSIONS: The think aloud evaluation provided useful insights into important
usability issues that require further development. Our enhanced AF dashboard was 
acceptable to clinicians and its impact on data quality and care should be
assessed in a formal study.

BACKGROUND: The immediate automatic systemic monitoring and reporting of adverse 
drug reactions, improving the efficacy is the utmost need of the medical
informatics community. The venturing of advanced digital technologies into the
health sector has opened new avenues for rapid monitoring. In recent years, data 
shared through social media, mobile apps, and other social websites has increased
manifolds requiring data mining techniques.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to highlight the role of advanced
technologies together with the traditional methods to proactively aid in the
early detection of adverse drug reactions concerned with drug safety and
pharmacovigilance.
METHODS: A thorough search was conducted on papers and patents regarding
pharmacovigilance. All articles with respect to the relevant subject were
explored and mined from public repositories such as Pubmed, Google Scholar,
Springer, ScienceDirect (Elsevier), Web of Science, etc. Results: The European
Union's Innovative Medicines Initiative WEB-RADR project has emphasized the
development of mobile applications and social media data for reporting adverse
effects. Only relevant data has to be captured through the data mining algorithms
(DMAs) as it plays an important role in timely prediction of risk with high
accuracy using two popular approaches; the frequentist and Bayesian approach.
Pharmacovigilance at the pre-marketing stage is useful for the prediction of
adverse drug reactions in the early developmental stage of a drug. Later,
post-marketing safety reports and clinical data reports are important to be
monitored through electronic health records, prescription-event monitoring,
spontaneous reporting databases, etc. Conclusion: The advanced technologies
supplemented with traditional technologies are the need of the hour for
evaluating a product's risk profile and reducing risk in population especially
with comorbid conditions and on concomitant medications.

BACKGROUND: Although several patient education materials on colonoscopy
preparation exist, few studies have evaluated or compared them; hence, there is
no professional consensus on recommended content or media to use.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to address this need by developing and evaluating a
new video on colonoscopy preparation.
METHODS: We developed a new video explaining split-dose bowel preparation for
colonoscopy. Of similar content videos on the internet (n=20), the most favorably
reviewed video among patient and physician advisers was used as the comparator
for the study. A total of 232 individuals attending gastroenterology or urology
clinics reviewed the new and comparator videos. The order of administration of
the new and comparator videos was randomly counterbalanced to assess the impact
of presentation order. Respondents rated each video on the following dimensions: 
information amount, clarity, trustworthiness, understandability, new or familiar 
information, reassurance, information learned, understanding from the patient's
point of view, appeal, and the likelihood of recommending the video to others.
RESULTS: Overall, 71.6% (166/232) of the participants preferred the new video,
25.0% (58/232) preferred the comparator video, and 3.4% (8/232) were not sure.
Furthermore, 64.0% (71/111) of those who viewed the new video first preferred it,
whereas 77.7% (94/121) of the participants who viewed the new video second
preferred it. Multivariable logistic regression analysis also demonstrated that
participants were more likely to prefer the new video if they had viewed it
second. Participants who preferred the new video rated it as clearer and more
trustworthy than those who preferred the comparator video.
CONCLUSIONS: This study developed and assessed the strengths of a newly developed
colonoscopy educational video.

BACKGROUND: Effective clinical decision support systems require accurate
translation of practice recommendations into machine-readable artifacts;
developing code sets that represent clinical concepts are an important step in
this process. Many clinical coding systems are currently used in electronic
health records, and it is unclear whether all of these systems are capable of
efficiently representing the clinical concepts required in executing clinical
decision support systems.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate which clinical coding systems
are capable of efficiently representing clinical concepts that are necessary for 
translating artifacts into executable code for clinical decision support systems.
METHODS: Two methods were used to evaluate a set of clinical coding systems. In a
theoretical approach, we extracted all the clinical concepts from 3 preventive
care recommendations and constructed a series of code sets containing codes from 
a single clinical coding system. In a practical approach using data from a
real-world setting, we studied the content of 1890 code sets used in an
internationally available clinical decision support system and compared the usage
of various clinical coding systems.
RESULTS: SNOMED CT and ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
Revision) proved to be the most accurate clinical coding systems for most
concepts in our theoretical evaluation. In our practical evaluation, we found
that International Classification of Diseases (Tenth Revision) was most often
used to construct code sets. Some coding systems were very accurate in
representing specific types of clinical concepts, for example, LOINC (Logical
Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) for investigation results and ATC
(Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification) for drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: No single coding system seems to fulfill all the needs for
representing clinical concepts for clinical decision support systems.
Comprehensiveness of the coding systems seems to be offset by complexity and
forms a barrier to usability for code set construction. Clinical vocabularies
mapped to multiple clinical coding systems could facilitate clinical code set
construction.

BACKGROUND: The complexity of health care data and workflow presents challenges
to the study of usability in electronic health records (EHRs). Display
fragmentation refers to the distribution of relevant data across different
screens or otherwise far apart, requiring complex navigation for the user's
workflow. Task and information fragmentation also contribute to cognitive burden.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to define and analyze some of the main sources of
fragmentation in EHR user interfaces (UIs); discuss relevant theoretical,
historical, and practical considerations; and use granular microanalytic methods 
and visualization techniques to help us understand the nature of fragmentation
and opportunities for EHR optimization or redesign.
METHODS: Sunburst visualizations capture the EHR navigation structure, showing
levels and sublevels of the navigation tree, allowing calculation of a new
measure, the Display Fragmentation Index. Time belt visualizations present the
sequences of subtasks and allow calculation of proportion per instance, a measure
that quantifies task fragmentation. These measures can be used separately or in
conjunction to compare EHRs as well as tasks and subtasks in workflows and
identify opportunities for reductions in steps and fragmentation. We present an
example use of the methods for comparison of 2 different EHR interfaces
(commercial and composable) in which subjects apprehend the same patient case.
RESULTS: Screen transitions were substantially reduced for the composable
interface (from 43 to 14), whereas clicks (including scrolling) remained similar.
CONCLUSIONS: These methods can aid in our understanding of UI needs under complex
conditions and tasks to optimize EHR workflows and redesign.

Introduction: With the shift of research focus to personalized medicine in
Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), there is an urgent need for tools that are capable of 
quantifying a patient's risk using diagnostic biomarkers. The Medical Informatics
Platform (MIP) is a distributed e-infrastructure federating large amounts of data
coupled with machine-learning (ML) algorithms and statistical models to define
the biological signature of the disease. The present study assessed (i) the
accuracy of two ML algorithms, i.e., supervised Gradient Boosting (GB) and
semi-unsupervised 3C strategy (Categorize, Cluster, Classify-CCC) implemented in 
the MIP and (ii) their contribution over the standard diagnostic workup. Methods:
We examined individuals coming from the MIP installed across 3 Italian memory
clinics, including subjects with Normal Cognition (CN, n = 432), Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI, n = 456), and AD (n = 451). The GB classifier was applied to
best discriminate the three diagnostic classes in 1,339 subjects, and the CCC
strategy was used to refine the classical disease categories. Four dementia
experts provided their diagnostic confidence (DC) of MCI conversion on an
independent cohort of 38 patients. DC was based on clinical, neuropsychological, 
CSF, and structural MRI information and again with addition of the outcome from
the MIP tools. Results: The GB algorithm provided a classification accuracy of
85% in a nested 10-fold cross-validation for CN vs. MCI vs. AD discrimination.
Accuracy increased to 95% in the holdout validation, with the omission of each
Italian clinical cohort out in turn. CCC identified five homogeneous clusters of 
subjects and 36 biomarkers that represented the disease fingerprint. In the DC
assessment, CCC defined six clusters in the MCI population used to train the
algorithm and 29 biomarkers to improve patients staging. GB and CCC showed a
significant impact, evaluated as +5.99% of increment on physicians' DC. The
influence of MIP on DC was rated from "slight" to "significant" in 80% of the
cases. Discussion: GB provided fair results in classification of CN, MCI, and AD.
CCC identified homogeneous and promising classes of subjects via its
semi-unsupervised approach. We measured the effect of the MIP on the physician's 
DC. Our results pave the way for the establishment of a new paradigm for ML
discrimination of patients who will or will not convert to AD, a clinical
priority for neurology.

OBJECTIVES: Electronic health record systems are increasingly used to send
messages to physicians, but research on physicians' inbox use patterns is
limited. This study's aims were to (1) quantify the time primary care physicians 
(PCPs) spend managing inboxes; (2) describe daily patterns of inbox use; (3)
investigate which types of messages consume the most time; and (4) identify
factors associated with inbox work duration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 1 month of electronic inbox data for 1275 PCPs
in a large medical group and linked these data with physicians' demographic data.
RESULTS: PCPs spent an average of 52 minutes on inbox management on workdays,
including 19 minutes (37%) outside work hours. Temporal patterns of electronic
inbox use differed from other EHR functions such as charting. Patient-initiated
messages (28%) and results (29%) accounted for the most inbox work time. PCPs
with higher inbox work duration were more likely to be female (P < .001), have
more patient encounters (P < .001), have older patients (P < .001), spend
proportionally more time on patient messages (P < .001), and spend more time per 
message (P < .001). Compared with PCPs with the lowest duration of time on inbox 
work, PCPs with the highest duration had more message views per workday (200 vs
109; P < .001) and spent more time on the inbox outside work hours (30 minutes vs
9.7 minutes; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Electronic inbox work by PCPs requires roughly an hour per workday, 
much of which occurs outside scheduled work hours. Interventions to assist PCPs
in handling patient-initiated messages and results may help alleviate inbox
workload.

University, New York, New York, USA.

OBJECTIVE: The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is 1 of the most
successful, collaborative efforts of terminology resource development in
biomedicine. The present study aims to 1) survey historical footprints, emerging 
technologies, and the existing challenges in the use of UMLS resources and tools,
and 2) present potential future directions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected 10 469 bibliographic records published
between 1986 and 2019, using a Web of Science database. graph analysis, data
visualization, and text mining to analyze domain-level citations, subject
categories, keyword co-occurrence and bursts, document co-citation networks, and 
landmark papers.
RESULTS: The findings show that the development of UMLS resources and tools have 
been led by interdisciplinary collaboration among medicine, biology, and computer
science. Efforts encompassing multiple disciplines, such as medical informatics, 
biochemical sciences, and genetics, were the driving forces behind the domain's
growth. The following topics were found to be the dominant research themes from
the early phases to mid-phases: 1) development and extension of ontologies and 2)
enhancing the integrity and accessibility of these resources. Knowledge discovery
using machine learning and natural language processing and applications in
broader contexts such as drug safety surveillance have recently been receiving
increasing attention.
DISCUSSION: Our analysis confirms that while reaching its scientific maturity,
UMLS research aims to boundary-span to more variety in the biomedical context. We
also made some recommendations for editorship and authorship in the domain.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides a systematic approach to map the
intellectual growth of science, as well as a self-explanatory bibliometric
profile of the published UMLS literature. It also suggests potential future
directions. Using the findings of this study, the scientific community can better
align the studies within the emerging agenda and current challenges.

Medicine, Marshall University, Huntington, WV, United States.

BACKGROUND: The Appalachian population is distinct, not just culturally and
geographically but also in its health care needs, facing the most health care
disparities in the United States. To meet these unique demands, Appalachian
medical centers need an arsenal of analytics and data science tools with the
foundation of a centralized data warehouse to transform health care data into
actionable clinical interventions. However, this is an especially challenging
task given the fragmented state of medical data within Appalachia and the need
for integration of other types of data such as environmental, social, and
economic with medical data.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present the structure and process of the
development of an integrated platform at a midlevel Appalachian academic medical 
center along with its initial uses.
METHODS: The Appalachian Informatics Platform was developed by the Appalachian
Clinical and Translational Science Institute's Division of Clinical Informatics
and consists of 4 major components: a centralized clinical data warehouse,
modeling (statistical and machine learning), visualization, and model evaluation.
Data from different clinical systems, billing systems, and state- or
national-level data sets were integrated into a centralized data warehouse. The
platform supports research efforts by enabling curation and analysis of data
using the different components, as appropriate.
RESULTS: The Appalachian Informatics Platform is functional and has supported
several research efforts since its implementation for a variety of purposes, such
as increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of diseases, risk identification, 
risk prediction, and health care resource utilization research and estimation of 
the economic impact of diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: The platform provides an inexpensive yet seamless way to translate
clinical and translational research ideas into clinical applications for regions 
similar to Appalachia that have limited resources and a largely rural population.

OBJECTIVE: To create an online visualization to support fatality management in
North Carolina.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A web application aggregates online datasets for
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection rates and morgue utilization. The
data are visualized through an interactive, online dashboard.
RESULTS: The web application was shared with state and local public health
officials across North Carolina. Users could adjust interactive maps and other
statistical charts to view live reports of metrics at multiple aggregation levels
(eg, county or region). The application also provides access to detailed tabular 
data for individual facilities.
DISCUSSION: Stakeholders found this tool helpful for providing situational
awareness of capacity, hotspots, and utilization fluctuations. Timely reporting
of facility and county data were key, and future work can help streamline the
data collection process. There is potential to generalize the technology to other
use cases.
CONCLUSIONS: This dashboard facilitates fatality management by visualizing county
and regional aggregate statistics in North Carolina.

The present era is witnessing rapid advancements in the field of medical
informatics and modern healthcare management. The role of translational
bioinformatics (TBI), an infant discipline in the field of medical informatics,
is pivotal in this revolution. The development of high-throughput technologies
[e.g., microarrays, next-generation sequencing (NGS)] has propelled TBI to the
next stage in this modern era of medical informatics. In this review, we assess
the promising translational outcomes of microarray- and NGS-based discovery of
genes, proteins, micro RNAs, and other active biological compounds aiding in the 
diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of prostate cancer (PCa) to improve treatment
strategies at the localized and/or metastatic stages in patients. Several
promising candidate biomarkers in circulating blood (miR-25-3p and miR-18b-5p),
urine (miR-95, miR-21, miR-19a, and miR-19b), and prostatic secretions (miR-203) 
have been identified. AURKA and MYCN, novel candidate biomarkers, were found to
be specifically expressed in neuroendocrine PCa. The use of BTNL2 gene mutations 
and inflammasomes as biomarkers in immune function-mediated, inherited PCa has
also been elucidated based on NGS data. Although TBI discoveries can benefit
clinical performance metrics, the translational potential and the in vivo
performance of TBI outcomes need to be verified. In conclusion, TBI aids in the
effective clinical management of PCa; furthermore, the fate of
personalized/precision medicine mostly relies on the enhanced diagnostic,
prognostic, and therapeutic potential of TBI.

Background: Suicide poses a significant health burden worldwide. In many cases,
people at risk of suicide do not engage with their doctor or community due to
concerns about stigmatisation and forced medical treatment; worse still, people
with mental illness (who form a majority of people who die from suicide) may have
poor insight into their mental state, and not self-identify as being at risk.
These issues are exacerbated by the fact that doctors have difficulty in
identifying those at risk of suicide when they do present to medical services.
Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) present opportunities for the
development of novel tools for predicting suicide.Method: We searched Google
Scholar and PubMed for articles relating to suicide prediction using artificial
intelligence from 2017 onwards.Conclusions: This paper presents a qualitative
narrative review of research focusing on two categories of suicide prediction
tools: medical suicide prediction and social suicide prediction. Initial evidence
is promising: AI-driven suicide prediction could improve our capacity to identify
those at risk of suicide, and, potentially, save lives. Medical suicide
prediction may be relatively uncontroversial when it pays respect to ethical and 
legal principles; however, further research is required to determine the validity
of these tools in different contexts. Social suicide prediction offers an
exciting opportunity to help identify suicide risk among those who do not engage 
with traditional health services. Yet, efforts by private companies such as
Facebook to use online data for suicide prediction should be the subject of
independent review and oversight to confirm safety, effectiveness and ethical
permissibility.

The impact of learning Unified Medical Language System knowledge embeddings in
relation extraction from biomedical texts.

Weinzierl MA(1), Maldonado R(1), Harabagiu SM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Human Language Technology Research Institute, Department of Computer Science, 
Erik Jonsson School of Engineering & Computer Science, University of Texas at
Dallas, Richardson, Texas, USA.

OBJECTIVE: We explored how knowledge embeddings (KEs) learned from the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus impact the quality of relation
extraction on 2 diverse sets of biomedical texts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two forms of KEs were learned for concepts and relation
types from the UMLS Metathesaurus, namely lexicalized knowledge embeddings (LKEs)
and unlexicalized KEs. A knowledge embedding encoder (KEE) enabled learning
either LKEs or unlexicalized KEs as well as neural models capable of producing
LKEs for mentions of biomedical concepts in texts and relation types that are not
encoded in the UMLS Metathesaurus. This allowed us to design the relation
extraction with knowledge embeddings (REKE) system, which incorporates either
LKEs or unlexicalized KEs produced for relation types of interest and their
arguments.
RESULTS: The incorporation of either LKEs or unlexicalized KE in REKE advances
the state of the art in relation extraction on 2 relation extraction datasets:
the 2010 i2b2/VA dataset and the 2013 Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction Challenge 
corpus. Moreover, the impact of LKEs is superior, achieving F1 scores of 78.2 and
82.0, respectively.
DISCUSSION: REKE not only highlights the importance of incorporating knowledge
encoded in the UMLS Metathesaurus in a novel way, through 2 possible forms of
KEs, but it also showcases the subtleties of incorporating KEs in relation
extraction systems.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating LKEs informed by the UMLS Metathesaurus in a relation 
extraction system operating on biomedical texts shows significant promise. We
present the REKE system, which establishes new state-of-the-art results for
relation extraction on 2 datasets when using LKEs.

BACKGROUND: In England, almost all general practices (GPs) have implemented GP
online services such as electronic personal health records (ePHRs) that allow
people to schedule appointments, request repeat prescriptions, and access parts
of their medical records. The overall adoption rate of GP online services has
been low, reaching just 28% in October 2019. In a previous study, Abd-Alrazaq et 
al adopted a model to assess the factors that influence patients' use of GP
online services in England. According to the previous literature, the predictive 
power of the Abd-Alrazaq model could be improved by proposing new associations
between the existing variables in the model.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to improve the predictive power of the Abd-Alrazaq
model by proposing new relationships between the existing variables in the model.
METHODS: The Abd-Alrazaq model was amended by proposing new direct, mediating,
moderating, and moderated mediating effects. The amended model was examined using
data from a previous study, which were collected by a cross-sectional survey of a
convenience sample of 4 GPs in West Yorkshire, England. Structural equation
modeling was used to examine the theoretical model and hypotheses.
RESULTS: The new model accounted for 53% of the variance in performance
expectancy (PE), 76% of the variance in behavioral intention (BI), and 49% of the
variance in use behavior (UB). In addition to the significant associations found 
in the previous study, this study found that social influence (SI) and
facilitating conditions (FCs) are associated with PE directly and BI indirectly
through PE. The association between BI and UB was stronger for younger women with
higher levels of education, income, and internet access. The indirect effects of 
effort expectancy (EE), perceived privacy and security (PPS), and SI on BI were
statistically stronger for women without internet access, patients with internet 
access, and patients without internet access, respectively. The indirect effect
of PPS on BI was stronger for patients with college education or diploma than for
those with secondary school education and lower, whereas the indirect effect of
EE on BI was stronger for patients with secondary school education or lower than 
for those with college education or a diploma.
CONCLUSIONS: The predictive power of the Abd-Alrazaq model improved by virtue of 
new significant associations that were not examined before in the context of
ePHRs. Further studies are required to validate the new model in different
contexts and to improve its predictive power by proposing new variables. The
influential factors found in this study should be considered to improve patients'
use of ePHRs.

Open Access is an upcoming paradigm to communicate scientific knowledge. The
Trans-O-MIM Project works on strategies, models, and evaluation metrics for the
goal-oriented, stepwise, sustainable, and fair transformation of established
subscription-based scientific journals into open-access-based journals. This
research intends to present an evaluation metric and the associated identified
appropriate parameters for such transformations. To develop the evaluation
metric, it has been implemented in the context of a business management method
for planning, steering and controlling action and corporate strategies. The
central element was a 3-step procedure for developing the metric. In stage 1
necessary preconditions for a transformation were considered. Stage 2 is the
actual elaboration of the evaluation metric by means of a scenario analysis and
stage 3 comprises the exemplary testing at the journal Methods of Information in 
Medicine. The three methodological steps have primarily resulted in 5 scenarios
with 9 different final states from the scenario analysis. Thus, the metric is now
composed of these 5 scenarios, which can be used to evaluate the success or
failure of a transformation. A list of 65 suitable parameters to measure changes 
in scenario were compiled. So, it is possible to evaluate the transformation and 
to find the current final state. Parameters like submissions, publications, and
time as well as the scenario states could be applied to the transformation
process of the Methods of Information in Medicine journal. The proposed
evaluation metric can be used to evaluate the transformation processes of
subscription-based journals into open-access-based journals.

BACKGROUND: The electronic health record (EHR) is a contributor to serious
patient harm occurring within a sociotechnical system. Chemotherapy ordering is a
high-risk task due to the complex nature of ordering workflows and potential
detrimental effects if wrong chemotherapeutic doses are administered. Many
chemotherapy ordering errors cannot be mitigated through systems-based changes
due to the limited extent to which individual institutions are able to customize 
proprietary EHR software. We hypothesized that simulation-based training could
improve providers' ability to identify and mitigate common chemotherapy ordering 
errors.
METHODS: Pediatric hematology/oncology providers voluntarily participated in
simulations using an EHR testing ("Playground") environment. The number of safety
risks identified and mitigated by each provider at baseline was recorded. Risks
were reviewed one-on-one after initial simulations and at a group
"lunch-and-learn" session. At three-month follow-up, repeat simulations assessed 
for improvements in error identification and mitigation, and providers were
surveyed about prevention of real-life safety events.
RESULTS: The 8 participating providers identified and mitigated an average of 5.5
out of 10 safety risks during the initial simulation, compared 7.4 safety risks
at the follow up simulation (p=0.030). Two of the providers (25%) reported
preventing at least one real-world patient safety event in the clinical setting
as a result of the initial training session.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based training may reduce providers' susceptibility to
chemotherapy ordering safety vulnerabilities within the EHR. This approach may be
used when systems-based EHR improvements are not feasible due to limited ability 
to customize local instances of proprietary EHR software.

BACKGROUND: A typical task in bioinformatics consists of identifying which
features are associated with a target outcome of interest and building a
predictive model. Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems such as the
Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) constitute an appealing approach to 
this end. However, in biomedical data, there are often baseline characteristics
of the subjects in a study or batch effects that need to be adjusted for in order
to better isolate the effects of the features of interest on the target. Thus,
the ability to perform covariate adjustments becomes particularly important for
applications of AutoML to biomedical big data analysis.
RESULTS: We developed an approach to adjust for covariates affecting features
and/or target in TPOT. Our approach is based on regressing out the covariates in 
a manner that avoids 'leakage' during the cross-validation training procedure. We
describe applications of this approach to toxicogenomics and schizophrenia gene
expression data sets. The TPOT extensions discussed in this work are available at
https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot/tree/v0.11.1-resAdj .
CONCLUSIONS: In this work, we address an important need in the context of AutoML,
which is particularly crucial for applications to bioinformatics and medical
informatics, namely covariate adjustments. To this end we present a substantial
extension of TPOT, a genetic programming based AutoML approach. We show the
utility of this extension by applications to large toxicogenomics and
differential gene expression data. The method is generally applicable in many
other scenarios from the biomedical field.

Since 2007, we have gradually been building up infrastructure for digital
pathology, starting with a whole slide scanner park to build up a digital archive
to streamline doing multidisciplinary meetings, student teaching and research,
culminating in a full digital diagnostic workflow where we are currently
integrating artificial intelligence algorithms. In this paper, we highlight the
different steps in this process towards digital diagnostics, which was at times a
rocky road with definitely issues in implementation, but eventually an exciting
new way to practice pathology in a more modern and efficient way where patient
safety has clearly gone up.

Impact of Provider Prior Use of HIE on System Complexity, Performance, Patient
Care, Quality and System Concerns.

USA.

To date, most HIE studies have investigated user perceptions of value prior to
use. Few studies have assessed factors associated with the value of HIE through
its actual use. This study investigates provider perceptions on HIE comparing
those who had prior experience vs those who had no experience with it. In so
doing, we identify six constructs: prior use, system complexity, system concerns,
public/population health, care delivery, and provider performance. This study
uses a mixed methods approach to data collection. From 15 interviews of medical
community leaders, a survey was constructed and administered to 263 clinicians.
Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance was used, along with Tukey HSD
tests for multiple comparisons. Results indicated providers whom previously used 
HIE had more positive perceptions about its benefits in terms of system
complexity (p = .001), care delivery (p = .000), population health (p = .003),
and provider performance (p = .005); women providers were more positive in terms 
of system concerns (p = .000); patient care (p = .031), and population health
(p = .009); providers age 44-55 were more positive than older and younger groups 
in terms of patient care (p = .032), population health (p = .021), and provider
performance (p = .014); while differences also existed across professional
license groups (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)) for all five
constructs (p < .05); and type of organization setting (hospital, ambulatory
clinic, medical office, other) for three constructs including system concerns
(p = .017), population health (p = .018), and provider performance (p = .018).
There were no statistically significant differences found between groups based on
a provider's role in an organization (patient care, administration,
teaching/research, other). Different provider perspectives about the value
derived from HIE use exist depending on prior experience with HIE, age, gender,
license (physician, nurse, other license, admin (no license)), and type of
organization setting (hospital, ambulatory clinic, medical office, other). This
study draws from the theory of planned behavior to understand factors related to 
physicians' perceptions about HIE value, serving as a departure point for more
detailed investigations of provider perceptions and behavior in regard to future 
HIE use and promoting interoperability.

BACKGROUND: Internet technologies can create advanced and rich web-based apps
that allow radiologists to easily access teleradiology systems and remotely view 
medical images. However, each technology has its own drawbacks. It is difficult
to balance the advantages and disadvantages of these internet technologies and
identify an optimal solution for the development of medical imaging apps.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare different internet platform technologies
for remotely viewing radiological images and analyze their advantages and
disadvantages.
METHODS: Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 were each used to develop a
comprehensive web-based medical imaging app that connected to a medical image
server and provided several required functions for radiological interpretation
(eg, navigation, magnification, windowing, and fly-through). Java-, Flash-, and
HTML5-based medical imaging apps were tested on different operating systems over 
a local area network and a wide area network. Three computed tomography
colonography data sets and 2 ordinary personal computers were used in the
experiment.
RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrated that Java-, Flash-, and
HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However, for 
3D, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest 
frame rate of volume rendering. However, it required the longest time for surface
rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had
the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without
platform dependence. Volume rendering, surface rendering, and fly-through
performances of the Flash-based app were significantly worse than those of the
other 2 apps.
CONCLUSIONS: Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 have individual strengths in the
development of remote access medical imaging apps. However, HTML5 is a promising 
technology for remote viewing of radiological images and can provide excellent
performance without requiring any plug-ins.

OBJECTIVE: To implement an automated quality assurance tool to prospectively
track discrepancies in musculoskeletal (MSK) exams submitted for second-opinion
radiology interpretation at a tertiary center.
METHODS: From 2013 to 2020, a standardized template was included in
re-interpretation MSK reports, and a concordance assessment compared with primary
interpretation was assigned. Analysis of standardized template implementation and
discordance rates was performed. Of the re-interpretations that demonstrated
likely clinically relevant discordance, a sample was randomly selected and the
EMR was reviewed to evaluate the impact on patient care and change in medical
management.
RESULTS: A total of 1052 re-interpretations were identified using the
standardized template. Services with higher requests for second-opinion
interpretation were oncology (n = 351, 33%) and orthopedic surgery (n = 255,
24%). Overall utilization rate of the template was 65% with marked decreased
during the last year (22% rate). In comparison to the primary report, there was a
30% discordance rate (n = 309) with 18% (n = 184) classified as likely clinically
relevant. From the subset of discrepancies that could be clinically relevant,
there was a change in management in 63% of the cases (19/30) with the
re-interpretation ultimately proving correct in 80% of the cases (24/30).
CONCLUSION: Implementation of a quality assurance tool embedded in the radiology 
workflow of second-opinion interpretations can facilitate the analysis of patient
care impact; however, stricter implementation is necessary. Oncologic studies
were the most common indication for re-interpretations. Although the primary and 
second interpretations in the majority of cases were in agreement, subspecialty
MSK radiology interpretation was shown to be more accurate than primary
interpretations and impacted clinical management in cases of discrepancy.

Factors Impacting Clinicians' Adoption of a Clinical Photo Documentation App and 
its Implications for Clinical Workflows and Quality of Care: Qualitative Case
Study.

Cambridge, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) tools have shown promise in clinical photo
and wound documentation for their potential to improve workflows, expand access
to care, and improve the quality of patient care. However, some barriers to
adoption persist.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the social, organizational, and
technical factors affecting clinicians' adoption of a clinical photo
documentation mHealth app and its implications for clinical workflows and quality
of care.
METHODS: A qualitative case study of a clinical photo and wound documentation app
called imitoCam was conducted. The data were collected through 20 in-depth
interviews with mHealth providers, clinicians, and medical informatics experts
from 8 clinics and hospitals in Switzerland and Germany.
RESULTS: According to the study participants, the use of mHealth in clinical
photo and wound documentation provides numerous benefits such as time-saving and 
efficacy, better patient safety and quality of care, enhanced data security and
validation, and better accessibility. The clinical workflow may also improve when
the app is a good fit, resulting in better collaboration and transparency,
streamlined daily work, clinician empowerment, and improved quality of care. The 
findings included important factors that may contribute to or hinder adoption.
Factors may be related to the material nature of the tool, such as the perceived 
usefulness, ease of use, interoperability, cost, or security of the app, or
social aspects such as personal experience, attitudes, awareness, or culture.
Organizational and policy barriers include the available clinical practice
infrastructure, workload and resources, the complexity of decision making,
training, and ambiguity or lack of regulations. User engagement in the
development and implementation process is a vital contributor to the successful
adoption of mHealth apps.
CONCLUSIONS: The promising potential of mHealth in clinical photo and wound
documentation is clear and may enhance clinical workflow and quality of care;
however, the factors affecting adoption go beyond the technical features of the
tool itself to embrace significant social and organizational elements. Technology
providers, clinicians, and decision makers should work together to carefully
address any barriers to improve adoption and harness the potential of these
tools.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first discovered in December 2019 and has since evolved 
into a pandemic.
OBJECTIVE: To address this global health crisis, artificial intelligence (AI) has
been deployed at various levels of the health care system. However, AI has both
potential benefits and limitations. We therefore conducted a review of AI
applications for COVID-19.
METHODS: We performed an extensive search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases for 
COVID-19-related English-language studies published between December 1, 2019, and
March 31, 2020. We supplemented the database search with reference list checks. A
thematic analysis and narrative review of AI applications for COVID-19 was
conducted.
RESULTS: In total, 11 papers were included for review. AI was applied to COVID-19
in four areas: diagnosis, public health, clinical decision making, and
therapeutics. We identified several limitations including insufficient data,
omission of multimodal methods of AI-based assessment, delay in realization of
benefits, poor internal/external validation, inability to be used by laypersons, 
inability to be used in resource-poor settings, presence of ethical pitfalls, and
presence of legal barriers. AI could potentially be explored in four other areas:
surveillance, combination with big data, operation of other core clinical
services, and management of patients with COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: In view of the continuing increase in the number of cases, and given
that multiple waves of infections may occur, there is a need for effective
methods to help control the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its shortcomings, AI holds
the potential to greatly augment existing human efforts, which may otherwise be
overwhelmed by high patient numbers.

BACKGROUND: Patients with rare diseases (RDs) are often diagnosed too late or not
at all. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) could support the diagnosis in 
RDs. The MIRACUM (Medical Informatics in Research and Medicine) consortium, which
is one of four funded consortia in the German Medical Informatics Initiative,
will develop a CDSS for RDs based on distributed clinical data from ten
university hospitals. This qualitative study aims to investigate (1) the relevant
organizational conditions for the operation of a CDSS for RDs when diagnose
patients (e.g. the diagnosis workflow), (2) which data is necessary for decision 
support, and (3) the appropriate user group for such a CDSS.
METHODS: Interviews were carried out with RDs experts. Participants were
recruited from staff physicians at the Rare Disease Centers (RDCs) at the MIRACUM
locations, which offer diagnosis and treatment of RDs. An interview guide was
developed with a category-guided deductive approach. The interviews were recorded
on an audio device and then transcribed into written form. We continued data
collection until all interviews were completed. Afterwards, data analysis was
performed using Mayring's qualitative content analysis approach.
RESULTS: A total of seven experts were included in the study. The results show
that medical center guides and physicians from RDC B-centers (with a focus on
different RDs) are involved in the diagnostic process. Furthermore,
interdisciplinary case discussions between physicians are conducted. The experts 
explained that RDs exist which cannot be fully differentiated, but rather
described only by their overall symptoms or findings: diagnosis is dependent on
the disease or disease group. At the end of the diagnostic process, most centers 
prepare a summary of the patient case. Furthermore, the experts considered both
physicians and experts from the B-centers to be potential users of a CDSS. The
experts also have different experiences with CDSS for RDs.
CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study is a first step towards establishing the
requirements for the development of a CDSS for RDs. Further research is necessary
to create solutions by also including the experts on RDs.

In the age of Evidence-Based Medicine, Clinical Guidelines (CGs) are recognized
to be an indispensable tool to support physicians in their daily clinical
practice. Medical Informatics is expected to play a relevant role in facilitating
diffusion and adoption of CGs. However, the past pioneering approaches, often
fragmented in many disciplines, did not lead to solutions that are actually
exploited in hospitals. Process Mining for Healthcare (PM4HC) is an emerging
discipline gaining the interest of healthcare experts, and seems able to deal
with many important issues in representing CGs. In this position paper, we
briefly describe the story and the state-of-the-art of CGs, and the efforts and
results of the past approaches of medical informatics. Then, we describe PM4HC,
and we answer questions like how can PM4HC cope with this challenge? Which role
does PM4HC play and which rules should be employed for the PM4HC scientific
community?

OBJECTIVE: The International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) has provided 
recommendations on Education in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) as
guidance on competencies relevant to education of BMHI specialists. However, it
remains unclear how well these competencies have been adopted to guide emerging
degree programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We evaluated
comprehensiveness of IMIA-recommended competency coverage by Masters in Health
Informatics (MSc HI) programs in East Africa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two investigators independently reviewed curricula for
seven accredited MSc HI university programs in the East Africa region to extract 
covered competencies using an instrument based on the IMIA education
recommendations. Descriptive statistics were used to determine competency
coverage by institution and across institutions and by IMIA-defined competency
domains. Duplication of competency coverage in courses within each curriculum was
also evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test whether
coverage of IMIA-recommended competencies differed between institutions.
RESULTS: Cohen's Kappa for coding competencies within courses was 0.738 (95% CI, 
0.713-0.764). Coverage of the 40 recommended required IMIA competencies by
institutional curricula ranged from 25 (62.5%) to 39 (97.5%) (p < 0.0001), with
only 18 (45%) of these competencies covered by all seven institutions. No
significant variations in competency coverage were observed between the domains
of information sciences (83.7%), health sciences (71.4%), and core BMHI
competencies (83.5%) (p = 0.13). On average, each competency was covered by 3.06 
courses in each curriculum (range 0 - 14). Curricula also contained 25 additional
competencies not part of the IMIA recommendations, 15 of which were found only
within the curriculum of a single institution.
DISCUSSION: There is significant variability in coverage of IMIA-recommended
competencies across MSc HI curricula evaluated, with observed duplication of
competency coverage within each curriculum. The additional competencies uncovered
that were not part of the IMIA-recommendations were not universally shared across
institutions.
CONCLUSION: The IMIA education recommendations provide a relevant, comprehensive 
reference guide for developing and improving health informatics degree programs
within LMIC settings. Variability in competency coverage needs to be addressed
for institutions within similar educational and labor regions.

INTRODUCTION: The Medication Regimen Complexity -Intensive Care Unit (MRC-ICU) is
the first tool for measuring medication regimen complexity in critically ill
patients. This study tested machine learning (ML) models to investigate the
relationship between medication regimen complexity and patient outcomes.
METHODS: This study was a single-center, retrospective observational evaluation
of 130 adults admitted to the medical ICU. The MRC-ICU score was utilized to
improve the inpatient model's prediction accuracy. Three models were proposed:
model I, demographic data without medication data; model II, demographic data and
medication regimen complexity variables; and model III: demographic data and the 
MRC-ICU score. A total of 6 ML classifiers was developed: k-nearest neighbor
(KNN), naïve Bayes (NB), random forest, support vector machine, neural network,
and logistic classifier (LC). They were developed and tested using electronic
health record data to predict inpatient mortality.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that adding medication regimen complexity
variables (model II) and the MRC-ICU score (model III) improved inpatient
mortality prediction.. The LC outperformed the other classifiers (KNN and NB),
with an overall accuracy of 83%, sensitivity (Se) of 87%, specificity of 67%,
positive predictive value of 93%, and negative predictive value of 46%. The
APACHE III score and the MRC-ICU score at the 24-hour interval were the 2 most
important variables.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Inclusion of the MRC-ICU score improved the prediction 
of patient outcomes on the previously established APACHE III score. This novel,
proof-of-concept methodology shows promise for future application of the MRC-ICU 
scoring tool for patient outcome predictions.

BACKGROUND: Despite digital health providing opportunities to enhance the
quality, efficiency and safety of primary healthcare, the adoption of digital
tools and technologies has been slow, partly because of poor digital health
literacy. For primary healthcare systems to take full advantage of these
technologies, a capable, digitally literate workforce is necessary. Still, the
essential digital health competencies (DHCs) for primary healthcare have not been
explored. This review aims to examine the broad literature on DHCs as it applies 
to Primary Care (PC) settings.
METHODS: We performed a scoping review on all types of research linking DHCs to
PC. We searched all major databases including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and
Cochrane Library in November 2019. Concurrently, a thorough grey literature
search was performed through OpenGrey, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and key
government and relevant professional associations' websites. Screening and
selection of studies was performed in pairs, and data was analysed and presented 
using a narrative, descriptive approach. Thematic analysis was performed to
identify key DHC domains.
RESULTS: A total of 28 articles were included, most of them (54 %) published
before 2005. These articles were primarily aimed at PC physicians or general
practitioners, and focused on improving knowledge about information technologies 
and medical informatics, basic computer and information literacy, and optimal use
of electronic medical records. We identified 17 DHC domains, and important
knowledge gaps related to digital health education and curriculum integration,
the need for evidence of the impact of services, and the importance of wider
support for digital health.
CONCLUSIONS: Literature explicitly linking DHCs to PC was mostly published over a
decade ago. There is a need for an updated and current set of DHCs for PC
professionals to more consistently reap the benefits of digital technologies.
This review identified key DHC domains and statements that may be used to guide
on the development of a set of DHC for PC, and critical knowledge gaps and needs 
to be considered. Such a DHC set may be used for curricula development and for
ensuring that the essential DHC for PC are met at a clinical or organizational
level, and eventually improve health outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Nursing informatics (NI) along with growth and development of health 
information technology (HIT) is becoming a fundamental part of all domains of
nursing practice especially in critical care settings. Nurses are expected to
equip with NI competency for providing patient-centered evidence-based care.
Therefore, it is important and necessary to improve nurses' NI competency through
educational programs for effective using of HIT. This study aimed to evaluate the
impact of a training program on NI competency of critical care nurses.
METHODS: This interventional study was conducted in 2019. Stratified sampling
technique was used to select 60 nurses working in critical care units of three
hospitals affiliated with a large University of Medical Sciences in the southeast
of Iran. These nurses were assigned randomly and equally to the control and
intervention groups. NI competency was trained to the intervention group in a
three-day workshop. Data were collected using demographic questionnaire and the
adapted Nursing Informatics Competency Assessment Tool (NICAT) before and 1 month
after the intervention. Rahman in the US (2015) developed and validated the
original NICAT to assess self-reported NI competency of nurses with 30 items and 
three dimensions (Computer literacy, Informatics literacy Information management 
skills). The NICAT is scored on a five-point Likert scale and the overall score
ranges from 30 to150. Two medical informatics specialists and eight nursing
faculty members approved the validity of the adapted version of NICAT and its
reliability was confirmed by Cronbach's alpha (95%).
RESULTS: All 60 participants completed the educational program and returned the
completed questionnaire. Majority of participants in the intervention and control
groups were female (83.30%), married nurses (70.90, 73.30%) aged 30-40 years
(51.6, 35.5%). In the pretest stage, both intervention and control groups were
competent in terms of the NI competency and its dimensions, and no significant
difference was observed between them (p = 0.65). However, in the posttest, the NI
competency and its dimensions in the intervention group significantly increased
with a large effect size compared with the control group (p = 0.001). This
difference showed that the intervention group was proficient in the posttest
stage. The highest mean difference in the intervention group was associated with 
the informatics literacy dimension and the lowest mean difference was associated 
with the informatics management skills dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: The improved scores of NI competency and its dimensions after using 
the training program implied the effectiveness of this method in enhancing the NI
competency of nurses working in the critical care units. The application of the
training program in diverse domains of nursing practice shows its high
efficiency. The project is fundamental for improving nurses' NI competency
through continuous educational programs in Iran, other cultures and contexts.

BACKGROUND: An estimated US $2.6 billion loss is attributed to health care fraud 
and abuse. With traditional health care claims verification and reimbursement,
the health care provider submits a claim after rendering services to a patient,
which is then verified and reimbursed by the payer. However, this process leaves 
out a critical stakeholder: the patient for whom the services are actually
rendered. This lack of patient participation introduces a risk of fraud and
abuse. Blockchain technology enables secure data management with transparency,
which could mitigate this risk of health care fraud and abuse.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a framework using blockchain to
record claims data and transactions in an immutable format and to enable the
patient to act as a validating node to help detect and prevent health care fraud 
and abuse.
METHODS: We developed a health care fraud and abuse blockchain technical
framework and prototype using key blockchain tools and application layers
including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, tokens, and governance based on 
digital identity on the Ethereum platform (Ethereum Foundation).
RESULTS: Our technical framework maps to the claims adjudication process and
focuses on Medicare claims, with the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (CMS) as the central authority. A prototype of the framework system was 
developed using the blockchain platform Ethereum (Ethereum Foundation), with its 
design features, workflow, smart contract functions, system architecture, and
software implementation outlined. The software stack used to build the system
consisted of a front-end user interface framework, a back-end processing server, 
and a blockchain network. React was used for the user interface framework, and
NodeJS and an Express server were used for the back-end processing server;
Solidity was the smart contract language used to interact with a local Ethereum
blockchain network.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed framework and the initial prototype have the potential 
to improve the health care claims process by using blockchain technology for
secure data storage and consensus mechanisms, which make the claims adjudication 
process more patient-centric for the purposes of identifying and preventing
health care fraud and abuse. Future work will focus on the use of synthetic or
historic CMS claims data to assess the real-world viability of the framework.

BACKGROUND: For effective rehabilitation after stroke, it is essential to conduct
an objective assessment of the patient's functional status. Several stroke
severity scales have been used for this purpose, but such scales have various
limitations.
OBJECTIVE: Gait analysis using smart insole technology can be applied
continuously, objectively, and quantitatively, thereby overcoming the
shortcomings of other assessment tools.
METHODS: To confirm the reliability of gait analysis using smart insole
technology, normal healthy controls wore insoles in their shoes during the Timed 
Up and Go (TUG) test. The gait parameters were compared with the manually
collected data. To determine the gait characteristics of patients with hemiplegia
due to stroke, they were asked to wear insoles and take the TUG test; gait
parameters were calculated and compared with those of control subjects. To
investigate whether the gait analysis accurately reflected the patients' clinical
condition, we analyzed the relationships of 22 gait parameters on 4 stroke
severity scales.
RESULTS: The smart insole gait parameter data were similar to those calculated
manually. Among the 18 gait parameters tested, 14 were significantly effective at
distinguishing patients from healthy controls. The smart insole data revealed
that the stance duration on both sides was longer in patients than controls,
which has proven difficult to show using other methods. Furthermore, the sound
side in patients showed a markedly longer stance duration. Regarding swing
duration, that of the sound side was shorter in patients than controls, whereas
that of the hemiplegic side was longer. We identified 10 significantly correlated
gait parameters on the stroke severity scales. Notably, the difference in stance 
duration between the sound and hemiplegic sides was significantly correlated with
the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) lower extremity score.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the feasibility and applicability of the smart 
insole as a device to assess the gait of patients with hemiplegia due to stroke. 
In addition, we demonstrated that the FMA score was significantly correlated with
the smart insole data. Providing an environment where stroke patients can easily 
measure walking ability helps to maintain chronic functions as well as acute
rehabilitation.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2), became a pandemic, hospitals activated
Hospital Incident Command Systems (HICS). At our institution, we included a role 
of Physician Clinical Support Supervisor (PCSS) in the HICS structure. The PCSS
role was filled by physicians who served hospital leadership positions, such as
Physician Advisor, Medical Staff leadership, Chief Quality Officer, and Chief
Medical Informatics Officer. In an effort to summarize the lessons learned by
implementation of the PCSS role during the COVID-19 pandemic, we evaluated a PCSS
working Microsoft Teams™ spreadsheet and the experience of physicians in the PCSS
role. Through efficient daily 2-way communication between frontline providers,
HICS, and hospital leadership, the PCSS role facilitated rapid change and
improved support for frontline staff, patients and families, and the health-care 
system. We recommend including the role of PCSS in HICS structure in the event of
future pandemics or other crises.

We aimed to develop and validate an instrument to detect hospital medication
prescribing errors using repurposed clinical decision support system data.
Despite significant efforts to eliminate medication prescribing errors, these
events remain common in hospitals. Data from clinical decision support systems
have not been used to identify prescribing errors as an instrument for
physician-level performance. We evaluated medication order alerts generated by a 
knowledge-based electronic prescribing system occurring in one large academic
medical center's acute care facilities for patient encounters between 2009 and
2012. We developed and validated an instrument to detect medication prescribing
errors through a clinical expert panel consensus process to assess physician
quality of care. Six medication prescribing alert categories were evaluated for
inclusion, one of which - dose - was included in the algorithm to detect
prescribing errors. The instrument was 93% sensitive (recall), 51% specific, 40% 
precise, 62% accurate, with an F1 score of 55%, positive predictive value of 96%,
and a negative predictive value of 32%. Using repurposed electronic prescribing
system data, dose alert overrides can be used to systematically detect medication
prescribing errors occurring in an inpatient setting with high sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: Automated systems that use machine learning to estimate a patient's
risk of death are being developed to influence care. There remains sparse
transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations
especially for implemented systems.
METHODS: A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic
medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality 
(including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed.
Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of
potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted
at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during
prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating
characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective
results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of
actionable predictions.
RESULTS: Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions
(94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and
female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model
incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating
characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1-88.2) and 28.0
(95% CI, 25.0-31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges
within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients
of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months,
41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32]
minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 
predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed
predictions) led to death within 60 days.
CONCLUSION: Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day
mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic
subpopulations. The model was implemented prospectively and successfully produced
meaningful estimates of risk within minutes of admission.

Defining patient-to-patient similarity is essential for the development of
precision medicine in clinical care and research. Conceptually, the
identification of similar patient cohorts appears straightforward; however,
universally accepted definitions remain elusive. Simultaneously, an explosion of 
vendors and published algorithms have emerged and all provide varied levels of
functionality in identifying patient similarity categories. To provide clarity
and a common framework for patient similarity, a workshop at the American Medical
Informatics Association 2019 Annual Meeting was convened. This workshop included 
invited discussants from academics, the biotechnology industry, the FDA, and
private practice oncology groups. Drawing from a broad range of backgrounds,
workshop participants were able to coalesce around 4 major patient similarity
classes: (1) feature, (2) outcome, (3) exposure, and (4) mixed-class. This
perspective expands into these 4 subtypes more critically and offers the medical 
informatics community a means of communicating their work on this important
topic.

BACKGROUND: Many studies are available in the literature about e-health in Saudi 
Arabia, however, data is limited to a few organizations and does not necessarily 
reflect the current and potential use of e-health for health care organizations
in the country. This study aimed to determine the level of awareness of Saudi
medical students of the internet-based health-related information seeking and
developing to support health services and significant predictors of their
practice.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 440 medical students in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, was conducted, during October/November 2019, using a previously validated
questionnaire, to assess: (1) knowledge in three domains; e-health definition (13
statements), fields of application of e-health (8 statements), methods of using
e-health (7 statements), (2) attitude toward using e-health (8 statements) and
(3) reported practice of e-health in medical training (5 statements). A scoring
system was used to calculate the total and percentage score of knowledge,
attitude, and practice for each student. Multiple regression analysis was applied
to identify predictors of e-health practice. Significance was considered at
p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of 440 medical students, the majority were females (55.7%) and from
families whose monthly income was more than 10,000SR (82.8%). Overall knowledge
about e-health was unsatisfactory (percentage mean score, PMS = 71.6%), with only
43.6% of students reporting a satisfactory level. However, this level was
satisfactory for fields of application (Percentage mean score-PMS = 76.6%) and
unsatisfactory for the definition of e-health (PMS = 70.7%) and methods of its
use (PMS = 65.7%) domains. The overall attitude towards e-health use was positive
(PMS = 82.3%), with nearly three-quarters of students (73.4%) reporting a
positive attitude. Generally, a good level of practice of e-health was reported
by students (PMS = 84.3%), with more than three-quarters of students (78.4%)
reporting good practice. Adjusting for age, gender, stream, educational grade,
and family monthly income, good practice was significantly predicted with higher 
knowledge (t = 2.22, p = 0.03) and attitude (t = 2.11, p = 0.04) scores.
CONCLUSION: This study provides basic information regarding medical students'
level of awareness of internet-based health-related information seeking and
developing to support health services. More resources should be directed to
elevate medical students' knowledge and to motivate them to practice e-health
using the available tools.

USA.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the application of systems and complexity
science principles to real patient care.
RATIONALE: Our current global health care system is not sustainable. It is
structured based on the principles of reductionist science, which was discovered 
and developed over the past 400 to 600 years. Because of increasing pace of
change and increasing complexity in our world, we have increased fragmentation in
our health care system leading to more harm and waste. Over 100 years ago, the
principles of systems, or complexity, science were discovered, first in the
discipline of physics. These principles accommodate the constant change and
biologic variability in our world. While reductionist principles would be
applicable in a static, mechanical world where parts of the system could be
isolated, this does not exist in the real biologic world.
METHODS: For the past decade, our abdominal wall hernia team has been applying
the principles of systems science to real patient care. Some of the tools we have
applied include continuous quality improvement for whole hernia patient processes
and non-linear analytical tools to gain insight to improve value-based outcomes. 
Until we learn to apply and scale these principles across our whole global health
care system, we will continue to suffer the consequences of our current
unsustainable system.
RESULTS: We have learned that the application of systems and complexity science
to real patient care can lead to lower costs and better outcomes in the context
of patients with complex hernia problems. However, these concepts have not yet
been adopted in our global health care system.
CONCLUSION: Applying the principles of systems and complexity science to our
global health care system has the potential to lower costs and improve patient
outcomes for any patient care process to which it is applied.

This paper reports on research to design an ensemble deep learning framework that
integrates fine-tuned, three-stream hybrid deep neural network (i.e., Ensemble
Deep Learning Model, EDLM), employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
extract facial image features, detect and accurately classify the pain. To
develop the approach, the VGGFace is fine-tuned and integrated with Principal
Component Analysis and employed to extract features in images from the Multimodal
Intensity Pain database at the early phase of the model fusion. Subsequently, a
late fusion, three layers hybrid CNN and recurrent neural network algorithm is
developed with their outputs merged to produce image-classified features to
classify pain levels. The EDLM model is then benchmarked by means of a
single-stream deep learning model including several competing models based on
deep learning methods. The results obtained indicate that the proposed framework 
is able to outperform the competing methods, applied in a multi-level pain
detection database to produce a feature classification accuracy that exceeds 89
%, with a receiver operating characteristic of 93 %. To evaluate the
generalization of the proposed EDLM model, the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain
dataset is used as a test dataset for all of the modelling experiments, which
reveals the efficacy of the proposed method for pain classification from facial
images. The study concludes that the proposed EDLM model can accurately classify 
pain and generate multi-class pain levels for potential applications in the
medical informatics area, and should therefore, be explored further in expert
systems for detecting and classifying the pain intensity of patients, and
automatically evaluating the patients' pain level accurately.

The death counts from COVID-19 have generated public controversy. The regional
health councils' need for information regardind the cases, has generated a
variety of formats and procedures, used to report this information. Consecuently,
this data has not always been communicated in a comparable maner to the Ministry 
of Health. The compilation of mortality statistics is complex. Central and
autonomous public administrations are involved, and not in the same way. The
medical death certificate (DC) is the main source of information that allows to
specify place of occurrence and causes of death. The on-line registration of the 
DC in the computerized civil registry and/or digital medical records, would allow
to establish a statistical processing circuit, and to obtain a death count more
quickly according to causes of death in the event of a health emergency. This
requires a multi-level institutional agreement for a total telematics statistic
process of death causes in Spain.

CONTEXT: Goals-of-care discussions are an important quality metric in palliative 
care. However, goals-of-care discussions are often documented as free text in
diverse locations. It is difficult to identify these discussions in the
electronic health record (EHR) efficiently.
OBJECTIVES: To develop, train, and test an automated approach to identifying
goals-of-care discussions in the EHR, using natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning (ML).
METHODS: From the electronic health records of an academic health system, we
collected a purposive sample of 3183 EHR notes (1435 inpatient notes and 1748
outpatient notes) from 1426 patients with serious illness over 2008-2016, and
manually reviewed each note for documentation of goals-of-care discussions.
Separately, we developed a program to identify notes containing documentation of 
goals-of-care discussions using NLP and supervised ML. We estimated the
performance characteristics of the NLP/ML program across 100 pairs of randomly
partitioned training and test sets. We repeated these methods for inpatient-only 
and outpatient-only subsets.
RESULTS: Of 3183 notes, 689 contained documentation of goals-of-care discussions.
The mean sensitivity of the NLP/ML program was 82.3% (SD 3.2%), and the mean
specificity was 97.4% (SD 0.7%). NLP/ML results had a median positive likelihood 
ratio of 32.2 (IQR 27.5-39.2) and a median negative likelihood ratio of 0.18 (IQR
0.16-0.20). Performance was better in inpatient-only samples than outpatient-only
samples.
CONCLUSION: Using NLP and ML techniques, we developed a novel approach to
identifying goals-of-care discussions in the EHR. NLP and ML represent a
potential approach toward measuring goals-of-care discussions as a research
outcome and quality metric.

BACKGROUND: The development of mobile technology for information retrieval and
communication, both at individual and health organizational levels, has been
extensive over the last decade. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is rapidly
adapting to the health care service contexts to improve treatment, care, and
effectiveness in health care services.
OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this scoping review is to explore the role of
citizen-patient involvement in the development of mHealth technology in order to 
inform future interventions. By identifying key characteristics of
citizen-patient involvement in system development, we aim to improve digital
communication and collaboration between health care providers and
citizen-patients, including sharing of health care data.
METHODS: The systematic scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute
methodology for scoping reviews by searching literature in 3 steps. We will
include literature reporting on the public, citizens, and patients participating 
in the development of mobile technology for health care purposes in MEDLINE,
CINAHL, Scopus, EMBASE, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. A preliminary
search was completed in MEDLINE and Scopus. The screening process will be
conducted by 2 of the authors. Data will be extracted using a data extraction
tool prepared for the study.
RESULTS: The study is expected to identify research gaps that will inform and
motivate the development of mHealth technology. The final report is planned for
submission to an indexed journal in November 2020.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this review will be the first review to provide
knowledge about how citizen-patients participate in system developments for
mHealth tools and the value that such involvement adds to the system development 
process.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Health information systems (HIS) are expected to be
effective and efficient in improving healthcare services, but empirical
observation of HIS reveals that most perform poorly in terms of these metrics.
Theoretical factors of HIS performance are widely studied, and solutions to
mitigate poor performance have been proposed. In this paper we implement
effective methods to eliminate some common drawbacks of HIS design and
demonstrate the synergy between the methods. JointCalc, the first comprehensive
patient-facing web-based decision support tool for joint replacement, is used as 
a case study for this purpose.
METHODS AND RESULTS: User-centred design and thorough end-user involvement are
employed throughout the design and development of JointCalc. This is supported by
modern software production paradigms, including continuous integration/continuous
development, agile and service-oriented architecture. The adopted methods result 
in a user-approved application delivered well within the scope of project.
CONCLUSION: This work supports the claims of high potential efficiency of HIS.
The methods identified are shown to be applicable in the production of an
effective HIS whilst aiding development efficiency.

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to understand the potential roles of a future
artificial intelligence (AI) documentation assistant in primary care
consultations and to identify implications for doctors, patients, healthcare
system, and technology design from the perspective of general practitioners.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were
conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation
context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these
problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop
activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping
methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive
thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed.
RESULTS: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general
practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI
collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these
themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant
recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future
consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system
involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the
core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning
the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient 
care.
CONCLUSIONS: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future
primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be
supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance
is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be 
designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, 
and doctor autonomy.

INTRODUCTION: A mixed-method, co-design approach to studying the adoption of
mobile health (mHealth) technology among African-American (AA) women has not been
fully explored. Qualitative data may contextualise existing knowledge surrounding
perceptions of mHealth among AA women as part of formative work for designing a
physical activity application (app).
METHODS: A convenience sample of 16 AA women completed an informatics survey
prior to participating in focus groups exploring their use of mobile technology
and health apps. Survey responses provided frequency data, while iterative
transcript analysis of focus groups identified themes.
RESULTS: The majority of participants (mean age=62.1 years, SD=6.6) felt
comfortable using a tablet/smartphone (75.0%). Most (68.8%) reported using
health-related apps, primarily focused on physical activity and nutrition. Focus 
groups revealed four overarching concepts, including (1) user attachment, (2)
technology adoption, (3) potential facilitators and (4) potential barriers.
Important features which may serve as facilitators or barriers to future adoption
of a mobile app for an mHealth intervention include individual app tailoring and 
software concerns, respectively.
DISCUSSION: Thematic analysis revealed high user attachment to smartphones and
described participants' process for adopting new mHealth technology.
CONCLUSION: Early engagement of target end users as a part of a broader co-design
and community-based participatory research process for developing mHealth
technologies may be useful for sustained adoption of these tools in future
mHealth behavioural interventions.

University of Graz, Graz, Austria.

OBJECTIVES: We survey recent developments in medical Information Extraction (IE) 
as reported in the literature from the past three years. Our focus is on the
fundamental methodological paradigm shift from standard Machine Learning (ML)
techniques to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We describe applications of this new
paradigm concentrating on two basic IE tasks, named entity recognition and
relation extraction, for two selected semantic classes-diseases and drugs (or
medications)-and relations between them.
METHODS: For the time period from 2017 to early 2020, we searched for relevant
publications from three major scientific communities: medicine and medical
informatics, natural language processing, as well as neural networks and
artificial intelligence.
RESULTS: In the past decade, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has
undergone a profound methodological shift from symbolic to distributed
representations based on the paradigm of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, this
trend is, although with some delay, also reflected in the medical NLP community. 
In the reporting period, overwhelming experimental evidence has been gathered, as
illustrated in this survey for medical IE, that DL-based approaches outperform
non-DL ones by often large margins. Still, small-sized and access-limited corpora
create intrinsic problems for data-greedy DL as do special linguistic phenomena
of medical sublanguages that have to be overcome by adaptive learning strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: The paradigm shift from (feature-engineered) ML to DNNs changes the 
fundamental methodological rules of the game for medical NLP. This change is by
no means restricted to medical IE but should also deeply influence other areas of
medical informatics, either NLP- or non-NLP-based.

Cordeliers, INSERM, Paris, France.

OBJECTIVES: Summarize recent research and select the best papers published in
2019 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics (BTI) for the
corresponding section of the International Medical Informatics Association
Yearbook.
METHODS: A literature review was performed for retrieving from PubMed papers
indexed with keywords and free terms related to BTI. Independent review allowed
the section editors to select a list of 15 candidate best papers which were
subsequently peer-reviewed. A final consensus meeting gathering the whole
Yearbook editorial committee was organized to finally decide on the selection of 
the best papers.
RESULTS: Among the 931 retrieved papers covering the various subareas of BTI, the
review process selected four best papers. The first paper presents a logical
modeling of cancer pathways. Using their tools, the authors are able to identify 
two known behaviours of tumors. The second paper describes a deep-learning
approach to predicting resistance to antibiotics in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The authors of the third paper introduce a Genomic Global Positioning System
(GPS) enabling comparison of genomic data with other individuals or genomics
databases while preserving privacy. The fourth paper presents a multi-omics and
temporal sequence-based approach to provide a better understanding of the
sequence of events leading to Alzheimer's Disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Thanks to the normalization of open data and open science practices,
research in BTI continues to develop and mature. Noteworthy achievements are
sophisticated applications of leading edge machine-learning methods dedicated to 
personalized medicine.

OBJECTIVE: To select, present, and summarize the best papers in the field of
Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) published in 2019.
METHODS: A comprehensive and standardized review of the biomedical informatics
literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published
in 2019, based on PubMed and ISI Web Of Knowledge queries.
RESULTS: Four best papers were selected among 1,189 publications retrieved,
following the usual International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook
reviewing process. In 2019, research areas covered by pre-selected papers were
represented by the design of semantic resources (methods, visualization,
curation) and the application of semantic representations for the
integration/enrichment of biomedical data. Besides new ontologies and sound
methodological guidance to rethink knowledge bases design, we observed large
scale applications, promising results for phenotypes characterization,
semantic-aware machine learning solutions for biomedical data analysis, and
semantic provenance information representations for scientific reproducibility
evaluation.
CONCLUSION: In the KRM selection for 2019, research on knowledge representation
demonstrated significant contributions both in the design and in the application 
of semantic resources. Semantic representations serve a great variety of
applications across many medical domains, with actionable results.

OBJECTIVES: To select, present, and summarize the most relevant papers published 
in 2018 and 2019 in the field of Ontologies and Knowledge Representation, with a 
particular focus on the intersection between Ontologies and Machine Learning.
METHODS: A comprehensive review of the medical informatics literature was
performed to select the most interesting papers published in 2018 and 2019 and
that document the utility of ontologies for computational analysis, including
machine learning.
RESULTS: Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in this survey paper. The
chosen articles belong to three major themes: (i) the identification of
phenotypic abnormalities in electronic health record (EHR) data using the Human
Phenotype Ontology ; (ii) word and node embedding algorithms to supplement
natural language processing (NLP) of EHRs and other medical texts; and (iii)
hybrid ontology and NLP-based approaches to extracting structured and
unstructured components of EHRs.
CONCLUSION: Unprecedented amounts of clinically relevant data are now available
for clinical and research use. Machine learning is increasingly being applied to 
these data sources for predictive analytics, precision medicine, and differential
diagnosis. Ontologies have become an essential component of software pipelines
designed to extract, code, and analyze clinical information by machine learning
algorithms. The intersection of machine learning and semantics is proving to be
an innovative space in clinical research.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize significant research contributions published in 2019 in 
the field of computerized clinical decision support and select the best papers
for the Decision Support section of the International Medical Informatics
Association (IMIA) Yearbook.
METHODS: Two bibliographic databases were searched for papers referring to
clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computerized provider order entry
(CPOE) systems. From search results, section editors established a list of
candidate best papers, which were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. The
IMIA Yearbook editorial committee finally selected the best papers on the basis
of all reviews including the section editors' evaluation.
RESULTS: A total of 1,378 articles were retrieved. Fifteen best paper candidates 
were selected, the reviews of which resulted in the selection of three best
papers. One paper reports on a guideline modeling approach based on clinical
decision trees, both clinically interpretable and suitable for implementation in 
CDSSs. In another paper, authors promote the use of extended Timed Transition
Diagrams in CDSSs to formalize consistently recurrent medical processes for
chronic diseases management. The third paper proposes a conceptual framework and 
a grid for assessing the performance of predictive tools based on the critical
appraisal of published evidence.
CONCLUSIONS: As showed by the number and the variety of works related to decision
support, research in the field is very active. This year's selection highlighted 
pragmatic works that promote transparency and trust required by decision support 
tools.

(3)Peter L. Reichertz Institute for Medical Informatics of TU Braunschweig and
Hannover Medical School, Braunschweig, Germany.

OBJECTIVE: To highlight noteworthy papers that are representative of 2019
developments in the fields of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics.
METHOD: A broad literature search was conducted in January 2020 using PubMed.
Separate predefined queries were created for sensors/signals and imaging
informatics using a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and
keywords. Section editors reviewed the titles and abstracts of both sets of
results. Papers were assessed on a three-point Likert scale by two co-editors,
rated from 3 (do not include) to 1 (should be included). Papers with an average
score of 2 or less were then read by all three section editors, and the group
nominated top papers based on consensus. These candidate best papers were then
rated by at least six external reviewers.
RESULTS: The query related to signals and sensors returned a set of 255 papers
from 140 unique journals. The imaging informatics query returned a set of 3,262
papers from 870 unique journals. Based on titles and abstracts, the section
co-editors jointly filtered the list down to 50 papers from which 15 candidate
best papers were nominated after discussion. A composite rating after review
determined four papers which were then approved by consensus of the International
Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board. These best
papers represent different international groups and journals.
CONCLUSIONS: The four best papers represent state-of-the-art approaches for
processing, combining, and analyzing heterogeneous sensor and imaging data. These
papers demonstrate the use of advanced machine learning techniques to improve
comparisons between images acquired at different time points, fuse information
from multiple sensors, and translate images from one modality to another.

Author information: 
(1)Institute of Medical Informatics, UMIT - Private University of Health
Sciences, Medical Informatics and Technology, Hall in Tirol, Austria.
(2)Medical Technologies Department, MCI - The Entrepreneurial School, Innsbruck, 
Austria.

OBJECTIVE: To give an overview of recent research and to propose a selection of
best papers published in 2019 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS).
METHOD: Each year, we apply a systematic process to retrieve articles for the CIS
section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. For six years now, we use
the same query to find relevant publications in the CIS field. Each year we
retrieve more than 2,000 papers. As CIS section editors, we categorize the
retrieved articles in a multi-pass review to distill a pre-selection of 15
candidate best papers. Then, Yearbook editors and external reviewers assess the
selected candidate best papers. Based on the review results, the IMIA Yearbook
Editorial Committee chooses the best papers during the selection meeting. We used
text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques to get an overview of the 
content of the retrieved articles.
RESULTS: We carried out the query in mid-January 2020 and retrieved a
de-duplicated result set of 2,407 articles from 1,023 different journals. This
year, we nominated 14 papers as candidate best papers, and three of them were
finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. As in previous years, the
content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by
CIS research.
CONCLUSIONS: We could observe ongoing trends, as seen in the last years. Patient 
benefit research is in the focus of many research activities, and
trans-institutional aggregation of data remains a relevant field of work.
Powerful machine-learning-based approaches, that use readily available data now
often outperform human-based procedures. However, the ethical perspective of this
development often comes too short in the considerations. We thus assume that
ethical aspects will and should deliver much food for thought for future CIS
research.

Health Information Management.

Author information: 
(1)Premier healthcare alliance, Washington, DC, USA.
(2)Graduate Programs in Health Informatics, Department of Health Services
Administration, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the recent literature and research and present a
selection of the best papers published in 2019 in the field of Health Information
Management (HIM) and Health Informatics.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section
editors with the help of a medical librarian. The search through bibliographic
databases for HIM-related papers was achieved using both MeSH headings and
keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was
first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent
external reviewers.
RESULTS: Over half of the 15 papers addressed the issue of data quality in the
electronic health record (EHR). In addition to the focus on data quality, there
were papers on other topics of long-standing interest to the field of HIM. These 
topics include privacy, security, and confidentiality of health information,
comparability of different coding vocabularies, classifications and
terminologies, and the HIM workforce. Finally, there were papers on newer topics 
for the HIM field, including mobile Health (mHealth), EHR use by public health
departments, and usability of different strategies for displaying information in 
the EHR.
CONCLUSIONS: Traditional HIM concerns about HIM practice and workforce as well as
issues about data in the EHR including data quality, coding, and privacy and
confidentiality continue to be a large part of the HIM research literature.
However, newer topics which reflect innovative and emerging technologies,
usability assessments, and the application of the EHR outside the traditional
clinical setting are starting to appear and more research is needed on these
newer areas.

(2)College of Engineering, The University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize significant research contributions on ethics in medical
informatics published in 2019.
METHODS: An extensive search using PubMed/Medline was conducted to identify the
scientific contributions published in 2019 that address ethics issues in medical 
informatics. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best
papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from
internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and
3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial
committee of the Yearbook.
RESULTS: The three selected best papers explore timely issues of concern to the
community and demonstrate how ethics considerations influence applied
informatics.
CONCLUSION: With regard to ethics in informatics, data sharing and privacy remain
primary areas of concern. Ethics issues related to the development and
implementation of artificial intelligence is an emerging topic of interest.

BACKGROUND: The International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI) is
the Academy of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). As an
international forum for peers in biomedical and health informatics, the Academy
shall play an important role in exchanging knowledge, providing education and
training, and producing policy documents.
OBJECTIVES: A major priority of the Academy's activities in its inaugural phase
was to define its strategy and focus areas in accordance with its objectives and 
to prioritize the Academy's work, which can then be transferred to respective
taskforces.
METHOD: This document reflects the major outcomes of intensive discussions that
occurred during 2019. It was presented at the Academy's 3rd Plenary on August
25th, 2019, in Lyon, France.
RESULTS: Regardless of the 'living nature' of the strategy and focus areas
document, it was concluded during the Plenary that the first version, which will 
be used as a base for decisions on the Academy's future activities, should be
made available to a broad audience. Three out of eight 'Visions for IAHSI',
presented in the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2018, were identified as
central for developing, implementing, and evaluating the Academy's strategic
directions: (1) advise governments and organizations on developing health and
health sciences through informatics, (2) stimulate progress in biomedical and
health informatics research, education, and practice, and (3) share and exchange 
knowledge. Taskforces shall be implemented to work in the following areas, which 
were considered as priority themes: (1) artificial intelligence in health: future
collaboration of entities with natural and with artificial intelligence in health
care, and (2) current landscape of standards for digital health.
CONCLUSIONS: Taskforces are now being established. Besides specific key
performance indicators, suggested for monitoring the work of theses taskforces,
the strategy to monitor the progress of the Academy itself has to be measured by 
relevant and acceptable metrics.

OBJECTIVES: To provide an introduction to the 2020 International Medical
Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook by the editors.
METHODS: This editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2020 IMIA
Yearbook which special topic is: "Ethics in Health Informatics". The keynote
paper, the survey paper of the Special Topic section, and the paper about Donald 
Lindberg's ethical scientific openness in the History of Medical Informatics
chapter of the Yearbook are discussed. Changes in the Yearbook Editorial
Committee are also described.
RESULTS: Inspired by medical ethics, ethics in health informatics progresses with
the advances in biomedical informatics. With the wide use of EHRs, the
enlargement of the care team perimeter, the need for data sharing for care
continuity, the reuse of data for the sake of research, and the implementation of
AI-powered decision support tools, new ethics requirements are necessary to
address issues such as threats on privacy, confidentiality breaches, poor
security practices, lack of patient information, tension on data sharing and
reuse policies, need for more transparency on apps effectiveness, biased
algorithms with discriminatory outcomes, guarantee on trustworthy AI, concerns on
the re-identification of de-identified data.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite privacy rules rooted in the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA and even more restrictive new
regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation published in May
2018, some people do not believe their data will be kept confidential and may not
share sensitive information with a provider, which may also induce unethical
situations. Transparency on healthcare data processes is a condition of
healthcare professionals' and patients' trust and their adoption of digital
tools.

BACKGROUND: A key challenge for improving the quality of health care is to be
able to use a common framework to work with patient information acquired in any
of the health and life science disciplines. Patient information collected during 
dental care exposes many of the challenges that confront a wider scale approach. 
For example, to improve the quality of dental care, we must be able to collect
and analyze data about dental procedures from multiple practices. However, a
number of challenges make doing so difficult. First, dental electronic health
record (EHR) information is often stored in complex relational databases that are
poorly documented. Second, there is not a commonly accepted and implemented
database schema for dental EHR systems. Third, integrative work that attempts to 
bridge dentistry and other settings in healthcare is made difficult by the
disconnect between representations of medical information within dental and other
disciplines' EHR systems. As dentistry increasingly concerns itself with the
general health of a patient, for example in increased efforts to monitor heart
health and systemic disease, the impact of this disconnect becomes more and more 
severe. To demonstrate how to address these problems, we have developed the
open-source Oral Health and Disease Ontology (OHD) and our instance-based
representation as a framework for dental and medical health care information. We 
envision a time when medical record systems use a common data back end that would
make interoperating trivial and obviate the need for a dedicated messaging
framework to move data between systems. The OHD is not yet complete. It includes 
enough to be useful and to demonstrate how it is constructed. We demonstrate its 
utility in an analysis of longevity of dental restorations. Our first narrow use 
case provides a prototype, and is intended demonstrate a prospective design for a
principled data backend that can be used consistently and encompass both dental
and medical information in a single framework.
RESULTS: The OHD contains over 1900 classes and 59 relationships. Most of the
classes and relationships were imported from existing OBO Foundry ontologies.
Using the LSW2 (LISP Semantic Web) software library, we translated data from a
dental practice's EHR system into a corresponding Web Ontology Language (OWL)
representation based on the OHD framework. The OWL representation was then loaded
into a triple store, and as a proof of concept, we addressed a question of
clinical relevance - a survival analysis of the longevity of resin filling
restorations. We provide queries using SPARQL and statistical analysis code in R 
to demonstrate how to perform clinical research using a framework such as the
OHD, and we compare our results with previous studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept project translated data from a single
practice. By using dental practice data, we demonstrate that the OHD and the
instance-based approach are sufficient to represent data generated in real-world,
routine clinical settings. While the OHD is applicable to integration of data
from multiple practices with different dental EHR systems, we intend our work to 
be understood as a prospective design for EHR data storage that would simplify
medical informatics. The system has well-understood semantics because of our use 
of BFO-based realist ontology and its representation in OWL. The data model is a 
well-defined web standard.

BACKGROUND: The popularization of health and medical informatics yields huge
amounts of data. Extracting clinical events on a temporal course is the
foundation of enabling advanced applications and research. It is a structure of
presenting information in chronological order. Manual extraction would be
extremely challenging due to the quantity and complexity of the records.
METHODS: We present an recurrent neural network- based architecture, which is
able to automatically extract clinical event expressions along with each event's 
temporal information. The system is built upon the attention-based and recursive 
neural networks and introduce a piecewise representation (we divide the input
sentences into three pieces to better utilize the information in the sentences), 
incorporates semantic information by utilizing word representations obtained from
BioASQ and Wikipedia.
RESULTS: The system is evaluated on the THYME corpus, a set of manually annotated
clinical records from Mayo Clinic. In order to further verify the effectiveness
of the system, the system is also evaluated on the TimeBank _Dense corpus. The
experiments demonstrate that the system outperforms the current state-of-the-art 
models. The system also supports domain adaptation, i.e., the system may be used 
in brain cancer data while its model is trained in colon cancer data.
CONCLUSION: Our system extracts temporal expressions, event expressions and link 
them according to actually occurring sequence, which may structure the key
information from complicated unstructured clinical records. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that combining the piecewise representation method with attention
mechanism can capture more complete features. The system is flexible and can be
extended to handle other document types.

Objective: With growing attention on the healthcare industry as a potential
market for big data and artificial intelligence in the Fourth Industrial
Revolution, countries around the world are introducing and developing various
policies and projects related to health information technology (HIT). To assist
prioritizing HIT topics in policy making, this study adopts the Delphi technique 
to garner expert opinions from various fields of health informatics.
Methods: Data were collected from November 2019 to February 2020 using the Delphi
technique through two rounds of surveys administered via email. The Delphi panel 
consisted of 16 experts with a high level of experience in health informatics.
They were from the Health Information Policy Advisory Committee of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare of Korea, and the board of directors of the Korean Society 
of Medical Informatics. The experts were asked to assess the importance, urgency,
and difficulty of HIT topics in three domains: technology, application, and
infrastructure.
RESULTS: Of the 40 topic items, a 100% agreement was reached for the importance
of 6 items, including 2 items in technology, 1 item in application, and 3 items
in infrastructure domains. Especially, Quadrant I of a 2×2 matrix showing high
importance and high urgency included 7 items in the technology domain, 2 items in
the application domain, and 13 items in the infrastructure domain.
Conclusion: Most items with high importance and urgency belonged to the
infrastructure domain. The findings indicated that fostering an infrastructural
environment should be polices with top priorities of HIT.

Cheonan, Korea.

Objective: The present study examined trends in search keywords related to the
oral health of infants and pregnant women using "social media cafés" on the
Korean portal site, Naver.
Methods: We obtained data from January 2015 to December 2017, collected by
searching for common terms related to oral health, such as "dental caries", "oral
health", "scaling", "tooth brushing", and "oral examination". Search results for 
these terms were organized by frequency and visualized by increase in the font
size with increasing frequency.
RESULTS: The ranking of keywords on Naver cafés for pregnant women and women with
infants was as follows (in descending order): "oral examination", "tooth
filling", and "tooth brushing". The "oral health" network was linked to "dental
caries", "oral health education", and "tooth brushing". In addition, the analysis
of trends of keyword frequencies according to time periods showed that "dental
caries" and "oral examination" were of highest interest to the café users.
Conclusion: We found a high interest in keywords related to preventive measures
for the oral health of infants and children, but there was a lack of awareness
regarding the oral health of pregnant women. These findings suggest that
prevention in infants and pregnant women is necessary, and that public awareness 
regarding education about oral healthcare needs to be raised.

BACKGROUND: New York City was the international epicenter of the COVID-19
pandemic. Health care providers responded by rapidly transitioning from in-person
to video consultations. Telemedicine (ie, video visits) is a potentially
disruptive innovation; however, little is known about patient satisfaction with
this emerging alternative to the traditional clinical encounter.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if patient satisfaction differs between 
video and in-person visits.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, we analyzed 38,609
Press Ganey patient satisfaction survey outcomes from clinic encounters (620
video visits vs 37,989 in-person visits) at a single-institution, urban,
quaternary academic medical center in New York City for patients aged 18 years,
from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Time was categorized as pre-COVID-19 and
COVID-19 (before vs after March 4, 2020). Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and
multivariable linear regression were used for hypothesis testing and statistical 
modeling, respectively.
RESULTS: We experienced an 8729% increase in video visit utilization during the
COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same period last year. Video visit Press Ganey 
scores were significantly higher than in-person visits (94.9% vs 92.5%; P<.001). 
In adjusted analyses, video visits (parameter estimate [PE] 2.18; 95% CI
1.20-3.16) and the COVID-19 period (PE 0.55; 95% CI 0.04-1.06) were associated
with higher patient satisfaction. Younger age (PE -2.05; 95% CI -2.66 to -1.22), 
female gender (PE -0.73; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.50), and new visit type (PE -0.75;
95% CI -1.00 to -0.49) were associated with lower patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient satisfaction with video visits is high and is not a barrier 
toward a paradigm shift away from traditional in-person clinic visits. Future
research comparing other clinic visit quality indicators is needed to guide and
implement the widespread adoption of telemedicine.

BACKGROUND: There is a need for automated approaches to incorporate information
on cancer recurrence events into population-based cancer registries.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of a novel data
mining algorithm to extract information from linked registry and medical claims
data on the occurrence and timing of second breast cancer events (SBCE).
METHODS: We used supervised data from 3092 stage I and II breast cancer cases
(with 394 recurrences), diagnosed between 1993 and 2006 inclusive, of patients at
Kaiser Permanente Washington and cases in the Puget Sound Cancer Surveillance
System. Our goal was to classify each month after primary treatment as pre-
versus post-SBCE. The prediction feature set for a given month consisted of
registry variables on disease and patient characteristics related to the primary 
breast cancer event, as well as features based on monthly counts of diagnosis and
procedure codes for the current, prior, and future months. A month was classified
as post-SBCE if the predicted probability exceeded a probability threshold (PT); 
the predicted time of the SBCE was taken to be the month of maximum increase in
the predicted probability between adjacent months.
RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier net probability of SBCE was 0.25 at 14 years. The
month-level receiver operating characteristic curve on test data (20% of the data
set) had an area under the curve of 0.986. The person-level predictions (at a
monthly PT of 0.5) had a sensitivity of 0.89, a specificity of 0.98, a positive
predictive value of 0.85, and a negative predictive value of 0.98. The
corresponding median difference between the observed and predicted months of
recurrence was 0 and the mean difference was 0.04 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Data mining of medical claims holds promise for the streamlining of 
cancer registry operations to feasibly collect information about second breast
cancer events.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 crisis forced hospitals in the UK dramatically to reduce
outpatient activity. To provide continuity of care and to assist patients
reluctant or unable to leave their homes, video consultations were rapidly
implemented across routine and emergency ophthalmology services.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the deployment and scaling to a large volume of
teleophthalmology using a video consultation platform 'Attend Anywhere' in
Moorfields Eye Hospital's accident and emergency (A&E) department (London, UK).
METHOD: Patient satisfaction, waiting time, consultation duration, outcome and
management were audited following the launch of the new virtual A&E service.
RESULTS: In the 12 days following the service launch, 331 patients were seen by
video consultation. 78.6% of patients (n=260) were determined not to need
hospital A&E review and were managed with advice (n=126), remote prescription
(n=57), general practitioner referral (n=27), direct referral to hospital
subspecialty services (n=26) or diversion to a local eye unit (n=24). Mean
patient satisfaction was 4.9 of 5.0 (n=62). The mean consultation duration was
12 min (range 5-31 min) and the wait time was 6 min (range 0-37 min).
CONCLUSION: Video consultations showed greater than expected usefulness in the
remote management of eye disease and supported a substantial reduction in the
number of people visiting the hospital.

BACKGROUND: Electronic medication systems (EMS) have been highly effective in
reducing prescribing errors, but little research has investigated their effects
on medication administration errors (MAEs).
OBJECTIVE: To assess changes in MAE rates and types associated with EMS
implementation.
METHODS: This was a controlled before and after study (three intervention and
three control wards) at two adult teaching hospitals. Intervention wards used an 
EMS with no bar-coding. Independent, trained observers shadowed nurses and
recorded medications administered and compliance with 10 safety procedures.
Observational data were compared against medication charts to identify errors
(eg, wrong dose). Potential error severity was classified on a 5-point scale,
with those scoring ≥3 identified as serious. Changes in MAE rates preintervention
and postintervention by study group, accounting for differences at baseline, were
calculated.
RESULTS: 7451 administrations were observed (4176 pre-EMS and 3275 post-EMS). At 
baseline, 30.2% of administrations contained ≥1 MAE, with wrong intravenous rate,
timing, volume and dose the most frequent. Post-EMS, MAEs decreased on
intervention wards relative to control wards by 4.2 errors per 100
administrations (95% CI 0.2 to 8.3; p=0.04). Wrong timing errors alone decreased 
by 3.4 per 100 administrations (95% CI 0.01 to 6.7; p<0.05). EMS use was
associated with an absolute decline in potentially serious MAEs by 2.4% (95% CI
0.8 to 3.9; p=0.003), a 56% reduction in the proportion of potentially serious
MAEs. At baseline, 74.1% of administrations were non-compliant with ≥1 of 10
procedures and this rate did not significantly improve post-EMS.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of EMS was associated with a modest, but significant,
reduction in overall MAE rate, but halved the proportion of MAEs rated as
potentially serious.

Up to 95% of novel interventions demonstrating significant effects at the bench
fail to translate to the bedside. In recent years, the windfalls of "big data"
have afforded investigators more substrate for research than ever before.
However, issues with translation have persisted: although countless biomarkers
for diagnostic and therapeutic targeting have been proposed, few of these
generalize effectively. We assert that inadequate heterogeneity in datasets used 
for discovery and validation causes their nonrepresentativeness of the diversity 
observed in real-world patient populations. This nonrepresentativeness is
contrasted with advantages rendered by the solicitation and utilization of data
heterogeneity for multisystemic disease modeling. Accordingly, we propose the
potential benefits of models premised on heterogeneity to promote the Institute
for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim. In an era of personalized medicine,
these models can confer higher quality clinical care for individuals, increased
access to effective care across all populations, and lower costs for the health
care system.

PURPOSE: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious respiratory
condition with high mortality and associated morbidity. The objective of this
study is to develop and evaluate a novel application of gradient boosted tree
models trained on patient health record data for the early prediction of ARDS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 9919 patient encounters were retrospectively analyzed from
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) data base.
XGBoost gradient boosted tree models for early ARDS prediction were created using
routinely collected clinical variables and numerical representations of radiology
reports as inputs. XGBoost models were iteratively trained and validated using
10-fold cross validation.
RESULTS: On a hold-out test set, algorithm classifiers attained area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.905 when tested for
the detection of ARDS at onset and 0.827, 0.810, and 0.790 for the prediction of 
ARDS at 12-, 24-, and 48-h windows prior to onset, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Supervised machine learning predictions may help predict patients
with ARDS up to 48 h prior to onset.

BACKGROUND: User satisfaction with PACS is considered as one of the important
criteria for assessing success in using PACS. The objective of this study was to 
determine the level of user satisfaction with PACS and to compare its functional 
features with traditional film-based systems.
METHODS: This study was conducted in 2017. Residents at three large university
hospitals in Kerman filled-out a self-administered questionnaire consisting of
three parts: demographic information of participants, user satisfaction with
PACS, comparing features of the two digital and traditional imaging systems. The 
validity of this questionnaire was approved by five medical informatics,
radiology, and health information management specialists and its reliability was 
confirmed by Cronbach's alpha (86%). Data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics and the Spearman, Mann Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis statistical tests.
RESULTS: The mean of the participants' ages was 31.4 (±4.4) years and 59% of the 
participants were females. The mean of physicians' satisfaction with PACS' had no
significant relationship with their age (P = 0.611), experience of using PACS
(P = 0.301), specialty (P = 0.093), and percent of interpretation of images with 
PACS (P = 0.762). It had a significant relationship with the participants'
computer skills (P = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: The mean of physicians' satisfaction with PACS was at a moderate to 
a high level, yet there are still problems in the successful implementation of
these systems and establishing interoperability between them. PACS has not fully 
met all the demands of physicians and has not achieved its predetermined
objectives, such as all-access from different locations.

Conventional electronic health record information displays are not optimized for 
efficient information processing. Graphical displays that integrate patient
information can improve information processing, especially in data-rich
environments such as critical care. We propose an adaptable and reusable approach
to patient information display with modular graphical components (widgets). We
had two study objectives. First, reduce numerous widget prototype alternatives to
preferred designs. Second, derive widget design feature recommendations. Using
iterative human-centered design methods, we interviewed experts to hone design
features of widgets displaying frequently measured data elements, e.g., heart
rate, for acute care patient monitoring and real-time clinical decision-making.
Participant responses to design queries were coded to calculate feature-set
agreement, average prototype score, and prototype agreement. Two iterative
interview cycles covering 64 design queries and 86 prototypes were needed to
reach consensus on six feature sets. Interviewers agreed that line graphs with a 
smoothed or averaged trendline, 24-h timeframe, and gradient coloring for urgency
were useful and informative features. Moreover, users agreed that widgets should 
include key functions: (1) adjustable reference ranges, (2) expandable
timeframes, and (3) access to details on demand. Participants stated graphical
widgets would be used to identify correlating patterns and compare abnormal
measures across related data elements at a specific time. Combining theoretical
principles and validated design methods was an effective and reproducible
approach to designing widgets for healthcare displays. The findings suggest our
widget design features and recommendations match critical care clinician
expectations for graphical information display of continuous and frequently
updated patient data.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs aim to
optimize antibiotic use and reduce inappropriate prescriptions through a panel of
interventions. The implementation of clinical guidelines is a core strategy of
AMS programs. Nevertheless, their dissemination and application remain low.
Computerised decision support systems (CDSSs) offer new opportunities for
semi-automated dissemination of guidelines. This qualitative study aimed at
gaining an in-depth understanding of the determinants of adherence to
antimicrobial prescribing guidelines and CDSSs adoption and is part of a larger
project, the COMPASS trial, which aims to assess a CDSS for antimicrobial
prescription. The final objective of this qualitative study is to 1) provide
insights from end-users to assist in the design of the COMPASS CDSS, and to 2)
help with the interpretation of the quantitative findings of the randomised
controlled trial assessing the COMPASS CDSS, once data will be analysed.
METHODS: We conducted semi-structured individual interviews among in-hospital
physicians in two hospitals in Switzerland and one hospital in France. Physicians
were recruited by convenience sampling and snowballing until data saturation was 
achieved.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine physicians were interviewed. We identified three themes
related to the potential barriers to guideline adherence: 1) insufficient
clarity, accessibility and applicability of guidelines, 2) need of critical
thinking skills to adhere to guidelines and 3) impact of the team prescribing
process and peers on physicians in training. As to the perception of CDSSs, we
identified four themes that could affect their adoption: 1) CDSSs are perceived
as time-consuming, 2) CDSSs could reduce physicians' critical thinking and
professional autonomy and raise new medico-legal issues, 3) effective CDSSs would
require specific features, such as ease of use and speed, which affect usability 
and 4) CDSSs could improve physicians' adherence to guidelines and patient care.
DISCUSSION: CDSSs have the potential to overcome several barriers for adherence
to guidelines by improving accessibility and providing individualised
recommendations backed by patient data. When designing CDSSs, mixed clinical and 
information technology teams should focus on user-friendliness, ergonomics,
workflow integration and transparency of the decision-making process.

Objective: To develop scalable natural language processing (NLP) infrastructure
for processing the free text in electronic health records (EHRs).
Materials and Methods: We extend the open-source Apache cTAKES NLP software with 
several standard technologies for scalability. We remove processing bottlenecks
by monitoring component queue size. We process EHR free text for patients in the 
PrecisionLink Biobank at Boston Children's Hospital. The extracted concepts are
made searchable via a web-based portal.
Results: We processed over 1.2 million notes for over 8000 patients, extracting
154 million concepts. Our largest tested configuration processes over 1 million
notes per day.
Discussion: The unique information represented by extracted NLP concepts has
great potential to provide a more complete picture of patient status.
Conclusion: NLP large EHR document collections can be done efficiently, in
service of high throughput phenotyping.

Background: As clinical services expand in community pharmacies, access to
patient information through a health information exchange (HIE) may be of
increased benefit to patient care. Objectives: To identify perceptions and
barriers to the use of HIE by high-performing clinical pharmacists within a
grocery store chain and collect other health care provider perceptions of using
HIE. Methods: Two web-based surveys consisting of multiple choice, select all
that apply, and 5-point Likert-type scale questions were administered via email
to Ohio pharmacists working in high clinical performing pharmacies and Ohio
health care providers utilizing CliniSync, an Ohio-based HIE program. Outcomes
measured included pharmacist perceptions of preparedness to participate in HIE,
their relationship with patients and health care providers, and barriers to
utilizing HIE. Provider outcomes included perceptions of relationships with
patients, awareness of community pharmacy services, referral habits, and
perceived benefit of a HIE. Results: Pharmacists tend to believe they have the
skill (median 5, interquartile range [IQR] 1) and desire (median 5, IQR 1) to be 
a part of the HIE network. Pharmacists appear confident in their abilities to
provide patient care as a part of HIE networks (median 4, IQR 1). While 66% of
providers surveyed are aware of services provided by community pharmacists, 75%
state that they do not refer patients to a pharmacy for those services.
Conclusion: Implementing HIE into clinical pharmacy workflow and encouraging
providers to use it to make patient health information available to pharmacists
would provide additional information for pharmacists to review when providing
clinical services in the community pharmacy setting, ultimately benefiting
patient care.

Structured reporting contributes to the completeness of radiology reports and
improves quality. Both the content and the structure are essential for successful
implementation of structured reporting. Contextual structured reporting is
tailored to a specific scenario and can contain information retrieved from the
context. Critical findings detected by imaging need urgent communication to the
referring physician. According to guidelines, the occurrence of this
communication should be documented in the radiology reports and should contain
when, to whom and how was communicated. In free-text reporting, one or more of
these required items might be omitted. We developed a contextual structured
reporting template to ensure complete documentation of the communication of
critical findings. The WHEN and HOW items were included automatically, and the
insertion of the WHO-item was facilitated by the template. A pre- and
post-implementation study demonstrated a substantial improvement in guideline
adherence. The template usage improved in the long-term post-implementation study
compared with the short-term results. The two most often occurring categories of 
critical findings are "infection / inflammation" and "oncology", corresponding to
the a large part of urgency level 2 (to be reported within 6 h) and level 3 (to
be reported within 6 days), respectively. We conclude that contextual structured 
reporting is feasible for required elements in radiology reporting and for
automated insertion of context-dependent data. Contextual structured reporting
improves guideline adherence for communication of critical findings.

This short report shares learning from the research and development phase of the 
national decision support programme in NHS Scotland. It outlines how the
programme has adopted an outcomes-focused approach which has guided critical
decisions on solution design, engagement of policy sponsors, clinical and
management leaders, implementation and evaluation approach, technical
architecture and technology development. It discusses how this outcomes-led
approach positions decision support as catalyst for a learning health and care
system that continuously refreshes the healthcare knowledge base through new
insights generated by evaluating impact and outcomes.

Computers can potentially play a key role in resolving knowledge mobilisation
bottlenecks in health and care through decision support at the point of care
based on computable biomedical knowledge (CBK). But the management of CBK comes
with a range of significant computer science challenges. Some of these have been 
suitably addressed through the development of CBK methods and tools, while others
require further research and development. We review the main challenges
associated with creating, reasoning with and sharing CBK, and describe current
state-of-the-art solutions as well as outstanding issues. We argue that a radical
approach, in which all evidence generation is suitable for computation at the
outset, is ultimately needed to take full advantage of CBK.

Computable biomedical knowledge (CBK) represents an evolving area of health
informatics, with potential for rapid translational patient benefit. Health Data 
Research UK (HDR UK) is the national Institute for Health Data Science, whose aim
is to unite the UK's health data to enable discoveries that improve people's
lives. The three main components include the UK HDR Alliance of data custodians, 
committed to making health data available for research and innovation purposes
for public benefit while ensuring safe use of data and building public trust, the
HDR Hubs, as centres of expertise for curating data and providing expert
domain-specific services, and the HDR Innovation Gateway ('Gateway'), providing
discovery, accessibility, security and interoperability services. To support CBK 
developments, HDR UK is encouraging use of open data standards for research
purposes, with guidance around areas in which standards are emerging, aims to
work closely with the international CBK community to support initiatives and aid 
with evaluation and collaboration, and has established a phenomics workstream to 
create a national platform for dissemination of machine readable and computable
phenotypical algorithms to reduce duplication of effort and improve
reproducibility in clinical studies.

BACKGROUND: Listening to "patient voices" in terms of symptoms, emotional status 
and experiences with care, is crucial for patient empowerment in clinical
practice. Despite convincing evidence that routine patient reported outcomes and 
experience measurements (PRMs) with rapid feed-back to oncologists can improve
symptom control, patient well-being and cost effectiveness, PRMs are not commonly
used in cancer care, due to barriers at various level. Part of these barriers may
be overcome through electronic PRMs collection (ePRMs) integrated with the
electronic medical record (EMR). The PATIENT VOICES initiative is aimed at
achieving a stepwise integration of ePRMs assessment into routine cancer care.
The feasibility project presented here is aimed at assessing the knowledge, use
and attitudes toward PRMs in a comprehensive cancer centre; developing and
assessing feasibility of a flexible system for ePRM assessment; identifying
barriers to and developing strategies for implementation and integration of ePRMs
clinical practice.
METHODS: The project has been organized into four phases: a) pre-development; b) 
software development and piloting; c) feasibility assessment; d)
post-development. A convergent mixed method design, based on concurrent
quantitative and qualitative data collection will be applied. A web-survey on
health care providers (HCPs), qualitative studies on patients and HCPs
(semi-structured interviews and focus groups) as well as longitudinal and
cross-sectional quantitative studies will be carried out. The quantitative
studies will enroll 600 patients: 200 attending out-patient clinics (physical
symptom assessement), 200 attending inpatient wards (psychological distress
assessment) and 200 patients followed by multidisciplinary teams (patient
experience with care assessment). The Edmonton symptom assessment scale, the
Distress Thermometer, and a tool adapted from existing patient reported
experience with cancer care questionnaires, will be used in quantitative studies.
A multi-disciplinary stakeholder team including researchers, clinicians, health
informatics professionals, health system administrators and patients will be
involved in the development of potentially effective implementation strategies in
the post development phase.
DISCUSSION: The documentation of potential advantages and implementation barriers
achieved within this feasibility project, will serve as a starting point for
future and more focused interventions aimed at achieving effective ePRMs routine 
assessment in cancer care.

Are specific elements of electronic health record use associated with clinician
burnout more than others?

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: The study sought to examine the association between clinician burnout 
and measures of electronic health record (EHR) workload and efficiency, using
vendor-derived EHR action log data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from a statewide clinician survey on
burnout with Epic EHR data from the ambulatory sites of 2 large health systems;
the combined dataset included 422 clinicians. We examined whether specific EHR
workload and efficiency measures were independently associated with burnout
symptoms, using multivariable logistic regression and controlling for clinician
characteristics.
RESULTS: Clinicians with the highest volume of patient call messages had almost 4
times the odds of burnout compared with clinicians with the fewest (adjusted odds
ratio, 3.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-10.14; P = .007). No other workload
measures were significantly associated with burnout. No efficiency variables were
significantly associated with burnout in the main analysis; however, in a subset 
of clinicians for whom note entry data were available, clinicians in the top
quartile of copy and paste use were significantly less likely to report burnout, 
with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.93; P =
.039).
DISCUSSION: High volumes of patient call messages were significantly associated
with clinician burnout, even when accounting for other measures of workload and
efficiency. In the EHR, "patient calls" encompass many of the inbox tasks
occurring outside of face-to-face visits and likely represent an important target
for improving clinician well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increased workload is associated with
burnout and that EHR efficiency tools are not likely to reduce burnout symptoms, 
with the exception of copy and paste.

The 2020 COVID-19 crisis has had and will have many implications for healthcare, 
including pathology. Rising number of infections create staffing shortages and
other hospital departments might require pathology employees to fill more urgent 
positions. Furthermore, lockdown measures and social distancing cause many people
to work from home. During this crisis, it became clearer than ever what an asset 
digital diagnostics is to keep pathologists, residents, molecular biologists and 
pathology assistants engaged in the diagnostic process, allowing social
distancing and a 'need to be there' on-the-premises policy, while working
effectively from home. This paper provides an overview of our way of working
during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis with emphasis on the virtues of digital
pathology.

Wikipedia contains rich biomedical information that can support medical
informatics studies and applications. Identifying the subset of medical articles 
of Wikipedia has many benefits, such as facilitating medical knowledge
extraction, serving as a corpus for language modeling, or simply making the size 
of data easy to work with. However, due to the extremely low prevalence of
medical articles in the entire Wikipedia, articles identified by generic text
classifiers would be bloated by irrelevant pages. To control the false discovery 
rate while maintaining a high recall, we developed a mechanism that leverages the
rich page elements and the connected nature of Wikipedia and uses a crawling
classification strategy to achieve accurate classification. Structured
assertional knowledge in Infoboxes and Wikidata items associated with the
identified medical articles were also extracted. This automatic mechanism is
aimed to run periodically to update the results and share them with the
informatics community.

Background: Telemedicine is not significantly spreading globally and large
variations in its availability and use exist internationally. Although many
factors already inhibit the dissemination of telemedicine, its complexly
intertwined factors make it more difficult to solve this problem. This study
aimed to analyze and visualize relationships among factors inhibiting the
dissemination of telemedicine. We applied the interpretive structural modeling
method and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification analysis.
Materials and Methods: Factors inhibiting the dissemination of telemedicine in
Japan were extracted by literature review and hearing from four medical
informatics experts belonging to a university or hospital using the Kawakita Jiro
method. Results: Eighteen factors were extracted as those inhibiting the
dissemination of telemedicine service in Japan: initial and operation cost,
research data, legal development, profitability, usability, human resources,
image quality, network speed, information security, technical limitation,
restriction for clinical practice, practice continuity, target use case, burden
for physicians, respondence, risks for clinical safety, understanding of medical 
staff, and understanding of patients. The hierarchical structure chart showed a
nine-level structure and the cross-impact matrix showed the relationship among
factors and the classification of them inhibiting the dissemination of
telemedicine. Discussion: We found that the underlying factors were high
implementation and operation costs, low research data, and risks for clinical
safety. Implementation and operation costs, research data, legal development, and
profitability have high driving power; thus, it is expected that the elimination 
of these inhibiting factors would lead to the dissemination of telemedicine.
Conclusions: There are many kinds of factors inhibiting the dissemination of
telemedicine in Japan. The result of this showed the structure of these factors
visually and could be useful to solve the problem inhibiting the dissemination of
telemedicine effectively and efficiently.

BACKGROUND: Physician burnout has a direct impact on the delivery of high-quality
health care, with health information technology tools such as electronic health
records (EHRs) adding to the burden of practice inefficiencies.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the extent of burnout among
physicians and learners (residents and fellows); identify significant EHR-related
contributors of physician burnout; and explore the differences between physicians
and learners with regard to EHR-related factors such as time spent in EHR,
documentation styles, proficiency, training, and perceived usefulness. In
addition, the study aimed to address gaps in the EHR-related burnout research
methodologies by determining physicians' patterns of EHR use through usage logs.
METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey methodology and a review of
administrative data for back-end log measures of survey respondents' EHR use,
which was conducted at a large Canadian academic mental health hospital.
Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to examine the association of
EHR-related factors with general physician burnout. The survey was sent out to
474 individuals between May and June 2019, including physicians (n=407),
residents (n=53), and fellows (n=14), and we measured physician burnout and
perceptions of EHR stressors (along with demographic and practice
characteristics).
RESULTS: Our survey included 208 respondents, including physicians (n=176) and
learners (n=32). The response rate was 43.2% for physicians (full-time: 156/208, 
75.0%; part-time: 20/199, 10.1%), and 48% (32/67) for learners. A total of 25.6% 
(45/176) of practicing physicians and 19% (6/32) of learners reported having one 
or more symptoms of burnout, and 74.5% (155/208) of all respondents who reported 
burnout symptoms identified the EHR as a contributor. Lower satisfaction and
higher frustration with the EHRs were significantly associated with perceptions
of EHR contributing toward burnout. Physicians' and learners' experiences with
the EHR, gathered through open-ended survey responses, identified challenges
around the intuitiveness and usability of the technology as well as workflow
issues. Metrics gathered from back-end usage logs demonstrated a 13.6-min
overestimation in time spent on EHRs per patient and a 5.63-hour overestimation
of after-hours EHR time, when compared with self-reported survey data.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of EHRs is a perceived contributor 
to physician burnout. There should be a focus on combating physician burnout by
reducing the unnecessary administrative burdens of EHRs through efficient
implementation of systems and effective postimplementation strategies.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surged in New York City, the 
city's public hospital system, New York City Health + Hospitals, recognized that 
innovative technological solutions were needed to respond to the crisis. Our
health system recently transitioned to a unified enterprisewide electronic
medical record across all of our hospitals. This accelerated our ability to
implement a series of technological solutions to the crisis. We engaged in
focused efforts to improve staff efficiency, including rapid medical screening
exams for low-acuity patients, use of "SmartNotes," and improved vital sign
monitoring. We standardized patient workup using specialty-specific order sets,
created dashboards to give insight into enterprisewide bed availability and
facilitate transfers from the hardest-hit hospitals, and improved the patient
experience by using tablets to connect patients with loved ones. The technology
bridged divides between different hospital systems across New York City to
encourage the sharing of data and improve patient care. By rapidly expanding its 
use of information technology, NYC Health + Hospitals was able to respond to the 
COVID-19 surge and is now better positioned to work in a more integrated fashion 
in the future.

Clinical-instrumental investigations, such as electrocardiography (ECG),
represent a corollary of a procedures that, nowadays, is called upon as part of
the principles of precision medicine. However when carrying out the professional 
routine examinations, most tend to ignore how a "simple" instrument can offer
indispensable support in clinical practice, even in occupational medicine. The
advent of the digital age, made of silicon and printed circuit boards, has
allowed the miniaturization of the electronic components of these electro-medical
devices. Finally, the adoption of patient wearables in medicine has been rapidly 
expanding worldwide for a number of years. This has been driven mainly by
consumers' demand to monitor their own health. With the ongoing research and
development of new features capable of assessing and transmitting real-time
biometric data, the impact of wearables on cardiovascular management has become
inevitable. Despite the potential offered by this technology, as evident from the
scientific literature, the application of these devices in the field of health
and safety in the workplace is still limited. This may also be due to the lack of
targeted scientific research. While offering great potential, it is very
important to consider and evaluate ethical aspects related to the use of these
smart devices, such as the management of the collected data relating to the
physiological parameters and the location of the worker. This technology is to be
considered as being aimed at monitoring the subject's physiological parameters,
and not at the diagnosis of any pathological condition, which should always be on
charge of the medical specialist We conducted a review of the evolution of the
role that electrophysiology plays as part of occupational health and safety
management and on its possible future use, thanks to ongoing technological
innovation.

BACKGROUND: In the dentistry field, the analysis of dental plaque is vital
because it is the main etiological factor in the 2 most prevalent oral diseases: 
caries and periodontitis. In most of the papers published in the dental
literature, the quantification of dental plaque is carried out using traditional,
non-automated, and time-consuming indices. Therefore, the development of an
automated plaque quantification tool would be of great value to clinicians and
researchers.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop a web-based tool called DenTiUS and
various clinical indices to evaluate dental plaque levels using image analysis
techniques.
METHODS: The tool was executed as a web-based application to facilitate its use
by researchers. Expert users are free to define experiments, including images
from either a single patient (to observe an individual plaque growth pattern) or 
several patients (to perform a group characterization) at a particular moment or 
over time. A novel approach for detecting visible plaque has been developed as
well as a new concept known as nonvisible plaque. This new term implies the
classification of the remaining dental area into 3 subregions according to the
risk of accumulating plaque in the near future. New metrics have also been
created to describe visible and nonvisible plaque levels.
RESULTS: The system generates results tables of the quantitative analysis with
absolute averages obtained in each image (indices about visible plaque) and
relative measurements (indices about visible and nonvisible plaque) relating to
the reference moment. The clinical indices that can be calculated are the
following: plaque index of an area per intensity (API index, a value between 0
and 100), area growth index (growth rate of plaque per unit of time in hours;
percentage area/hour), and area time index (the time in days needed to achieve a 
plaque area of 100% concerning the initial area at the same moment). Images and
graphics can be obtained for a moment from a patient in addition to a full report
presenting all the processing data. Dentistry experts evaluated the DenTiUS
Plaque software through a usability test, with the best-scoring questions those
related to the workflow efficiency, value of the online help, attractiveness of
the user interface, and overall satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: The DenTiUS Plaque software allows automatic, reliable, and
repeatable quantification of dental plaque levels, providing information about
area, intensity, and growth pattern. Dentistry experts recognized that this
software is suitable for quantification of dental plaque levels. Consequently,
its application in the analysis of plaque evolution patterns associated with
different oral conditions, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of various
oral hygiene measures, can represent an improvement in the clinical setting and
the methodological quality of research studies.

and Neck Surgery, University Hospital Würzburg, Josef-Schneider-Straße 11, 97080,
Würzburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of
neuromuscular facial training in the rehabilitation of patients with facial
palsy. However, printed instructions for home training are often not of optimum
quality and associated with low adherence to therapy. Professional guidance,
e.g., by occupational therapists, is regarded as being of high quality, but is
associated with a high cost burden, particularly in chronic forms of disease.
OBJECTIVE: The idea to develop a smartphone app for facial training arose from
the above-described situation. The aim was to provide structured exercises for
the mimic muscles in the sense of neuromuscular training with visual feedback via
the front camera of the device.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A native app architecture in iOS was chosen to implement
the graphical and content-related concept. In the Apple Xcode (Apple, Cupertino, 
CA, US) development environment, the app's code was written in the Swift
programming language (Apple) and the graphical user interface was created.
RESULTS: An app prototype was implemented that provides step-by-step instructions
on selected mimic exercises via animated smileys. The duration and speed of the
exercise can be varied within a limited range. In the development environment,
the correct functionality of both physical and virtual devices was successfully
tested.
CONCLUSION: App-based facial training offers attractive opportunities to motivate
patients for improved adherence to treatment, which could hypothetically lead to 
a better outcome. Evaluation of this question is planned in a clinical trial
after completion of the development.

Scientific research is mostly published in English, regardless of the
researcher's nationality. However, this growing practice impairs or hinders the
comprehension of professionals who depend on the results of these studies to
provide adequate care for their patients. We suggest that machine translation
(MT) can be used as a way of providing useful translation for biomedical
articles, even though the translation itself may not be fluent. To tackle
possible mistranslation that can harm a patient, we resort to crowd-sourced
validation of translations. We developed a prototype of MT validation and
edition, where users can vote for that translation as valid, or suggest
modifications (i.e., post-editing the MT). A glossary match system is also
included, aiming at terminology consistency.

BACKGROUND: Mobile applications and social media serve their users as convenient 
tools to improve and monitor diseases and conditions such as pregnancy. These
tools also exert a positive impact on Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
self-management.
INTRODUCTION: Despite the expansion of mobile health apps for the management of
GDM, no study has evaluated these apps using a valid tool. This study aimed to
search and review the apps developed for this purpose, providing overall and
specific rating scores for each aspect of MARS.
METHODS: Two cases of app stores (IOS and Google Play) were searched in January
2019 for apps related to GDM. Search keywords included "gestational diabetes",
"pregnant diabetes", and "Health apps". Eligibility criteria include: capable of 
running on Android or IOS operating systems, in the English language, especially 
for GDM, and available in Iran. After removal of duplicates, the apps were
reviewed, rated, and evaluated independently by two reviewers with Mobile App
Rating Scale (MARS) tools.
RESULTS: Initially, 102 apps were identified after the exclusion process, five
selected apps were downloaded and analyzed. All apps were classified into four
categories according to contents and their interactive capabilities. In most
quadrants of MARS, the Pregnant with Diabetes app received the highest scores.
Also, in general, the maximum app quality mean score belonged to Pregnant with
Diabetes (3.10 / 5.00).
CONCLUSION: Findings revealed that apps designed for GDM are small in number and 
poor in quality based on MARS tools. Therefore, considering pregnant women's need
for using the capabilities of these apps in pregnancy management and promoting
community-based care, it seems essential to develop and design a series of
high-quality apps in all four specified categories (only giving comments,
obtaining data and giving comments, diagnosis of GDM, and diet calculator).

Guard - Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) systems generate large datasets that
can significantly enrich the development of medical predictive models. Several
attempts have been made to investigate the effect of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
elevation on the prediction of diabetes onset. However, there is still a need for
validation of these models using EHR data collected from different populations.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to perform a replication study to validate,
evaluate, and identify the strengths and weaknesses of replicating a predictive
model that employed multiple logistic regression with EHR data to forecast the
levels of HbA1c. The original study used data from a population in the United
States and this differentiated replication used a population in Saudi Arabia.
METHODS: A total of 3 models were developed and compared with the model created
in the original study. The models were trained and tested using a larger dataset 
from Saudi Arabia with 36,378 records. The 10-fold cross-validation approach was 
used for measuring the performance of the models.
RESULTS: Applying the method employed in the original study achieved an accuracy 
of 74% to 75% when using the dataset collected from Saudi Arabia, compared with
77% obtained from using the population from the United States. The results also
show a different ranking of importance for the predictors between the original
study and the replication. The order of importance for the predictors with our
population, from the most to the least importance, is age, random blood sugar,
estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol, non-high-density
lipoprotein, and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: This replication study shows that direct use of the models
(calculators) created using multiple logistic regression to predict the level of 
HbA1c may not be appropriate for all populations. This study reveals that the
weighting of the predictors needs to be calibrated to the population used.
However, the study does confirm that replicating the original study using a
different population can help with predicting the levels of HbA1c by using the
predictors that are routinely collected and stored in hospital EHR systems.

Is the Quality of Toothache-Related Information Published in Brazilian Websites
Adequate to Assist People in Seeking Dental Treatment?

Lotto M, Aguirre PEA, Neto NL, Cruvinel AF, Cruvinel T.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the readability and the quality of
toothache-related information found in Brazilian websites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five websites retrieved from Google Search, Baidu,
Yahoo! and Bing were evaluated by two independent examiners using the DISCERN
questionnaire, the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark
criteria and the Flesch Reading Ease adapted to Brazilian Portuguese (FRE-BP).
Additionally, the websites were categorised according to their information,
adopting four criteria related to: (i) endodontic pain, (ii) toothache relief or 
treatment, (iii) the self-resolution of pain, and (iv) the promotion of home
remedies usage. The statistical analysis was performed using Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, hierarchical clustering analysis by
Ward's minimum variance method, Kruskal-Wallis test, post-hoc Dunn's test and
Chisquare test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The overall means (± SD) of DISCERN and FRE-BP were, respectively, 31.02
(± 5.56) and 61.20 (± 11.79), without quality-based differences between the
websites with health- and non-health-related authors, and distinct clusters.
CONCLUSION: Therefore, the quality of toothache-related information found in this

Objective: There has been substantial growth in eHealth over the past decade,
driven by expectations of improved healthcare system performance. Despite
substantial eHealth investment, little is known about the monitoring and
evaluation strategies for gauging progress in eHealth availability and use. This 
scoping review aims to map the existing literature and depict the predominant
approaches and methodological recommendations to national and regional monitoring
and evaluation of eHealth availability and use, to advance national strategies
for monitoring and evaluating eHealth.
Methods: Peer-reviewed and grey literature on monitoring and evaluation of
eHealth availability and use published between January 1, 2009, and March 11,
2019, were eligible for inclusion. A total of 2354 publications were identified
and 36 publications were included after full-text review. Data on publication
type (eg, empirical research), country, level (national or regional), publication
year, method (eg, survey), and domain (eg, provider-centric electronic record)
were charted.
Results: The majority of publications monitored availability alone or applied a
combination of availability and use measures. Surveys were the most common data
collection method (used in 86% of the publications). Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Commission, Canada Health Infoway, 
and World Health Organization (WHO) have developed comprehensive eHealth
monitoring and evaluation methodology recommendations.
Discussion: Establishing continuous national eHealth monitoring and evaluation,
based on international approaches and recommendations, could improve the ability 
for cross-country benchmarking and learning. This scoping review provides an
overview of the predominant approaches to and recommendations for national and
regional monitoring and evaluation of eHealth. It thereby provides a starting
point for developing national eHealth monitoring strategies.

Germany.

The HiGHmed research project as part of Germany's Medical Informatics Initiative 
aims to establish Medical Data Integration Centers (MeDIC) at each participating 
institution to integrate data of multiple primary information systems in a single
place. The MeDICs are based on an IHE XDS.b Affinity Domain in conjunction with
an openEHR clinical data repository. This paper presents two ways of storing and 
retrieving structured and semantically annotated data from an openEHR repository 
whilst keeping data integrated in an existing IHE XDS.b infrastructure.
Furthermore, the paper discusses multiple benefits of the presented approach as
well as challenges and corresponding solutions.

Within the HiGHmeducation consortium various online learning modules shall be
developed by members of the consortium to address the increasing need for skilled
professionals in a networked and digitalized healthcare system. Transferability
of these modules to other locations is one main objective for the design of
online learning modules. Thus, a didactical framework for online learning modules
was developed. To ensure feasibility of the framework, the participating
universities were analyzed concerning availability of e-learning support
structures and infrastructures including learning management systems (LMS). The
analysis especially focuses on the various LMS learning tools and their
suitability for the framework. The framework is the basis for 12 HiGHmeducation
online learning modules of which a part has firstly been conducted in winter
2019/20 and leads to a comparable structure of the modules.

Leipzig, Germany.

Having precise information about health IT evaluation studies is important for
evidence-based decisions in medical informatics. In a former feasibility study,
we used a faceted search based on ontological modeling of key elements of studies
to retrieve precisely described health IT evaluation studies. However, extracting
the key elements manually for the modeling of the ontology was time and
resource-intensive. We now aimed at applying natural language processing to
substitute manual data extraction by automatic data extraction. Four methods
(Named Entity Recognition, Bag-of-Words,
Term-Frequency-Inverse-Document-Frequency, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic 
Modeling were applied to 24 health IT evaluation studies. We evaluated which of
these methods was best suited for extracting key elements of each study. As gold 
standard, we used results from manual extraction. As a result, Named Entity
Recognition is promising but needs to be adapted to the existing study context.
After the adaption, key elements of studies could be collected in a more
feasible, time- and resource-saving way.

The primary objective of this study was to identify meaningful indicators of
patient portal use deemed important to psychiatric consumers. The secondary
objectives were to uncover: 1) barriers and facilitators to patient portal use;
and, 2) desired functionality of the technology by psychiatric consumers.A
qualitative descriptive study was conducted using focus groups consisting of
psychiatric consumers, their family members/caregivers, and Peer Support Workers.
Two members of the research team independently performed a content analysis, and 
came to agreement on the identified coding hierarchy and themes. A total of
twenty-three participants took part in one of five focus groups. Engagement and
empowerment, consumer experience and satisfaction, and quality of care were
identified as outcome indicators. Privacy and security, portal usage, and
usability were identified as important process indicators. A number of barriers
and facilitators were identified. Finally, psychiatric consumers desired
functionality of a patient portal were discussed.Findings suggest that patient
portal research among psychiatric populations can be conducted using many of the 
indicators that have previously been used for physical health populations.
However, this study identified other unique considerations that should be
accounted for when evaluating a patient portal among psychiatric populations.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) help to improve the diagnostics and
treatment of rare diseases (RD). As one of four funded consortia of the Medical
Informatics Initiative supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and
Research (BMBF, Germany), MIRACUM develops a clinical decision support system
(CDSS) for RD based on distributed data of ten university hospitals. The CDSS
will be developed at the Rare Diseases Centres (RDC) of the MIRACUM consortium.
Since it is essential to deliver decision support at the right time and place in 
the clinician's workflow, this study aimed to capture relevant information of the
RDCs regarding patient admission and diagnostic process. Additionally, we
investigated how patient documentation and digitalisation is performed at the
centres. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey involving experts in
the RDs domain to capture relevant information for the further development of a
CDSS in RD. For each centre, one expert on RDs participated in the study (n=8).
The survey identified several challenges regarding the reuse of patient data,
e.g. the paper-based documentation of a patientâĂŹs medical history and coding of
diagnoses using ICD-10. However, we noticed a relevant use of current software
diagnosis support and a similarly performed diagnostic process in all RDC.
Further studies are needed to get more detailed insights and to define specific
requirements.

BACKGROUND: Information and communications technologies (ICTs) may facilitate
shorting length of stay (LOS) of patients through the optimization of processes
and delivery services.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide technology-based solutions and
interventions based on health information technology (HIT) that have optimization
potentials of patients' LOS.
METHODS: This review study searched papers in PubMed, Scopus as well as Google
Scholar without presuming time limits by the end of 2019. English and Persian
Papers were included, which addressed an association between the ICT and LOS as
well as its positive effect in shortening LOS.
RESULTS: Identified technologies were finally classified into eleven groups.
Based on the findings, common health technologies such as health information
systems, telemedicine especially tele-consultation, electronic discharge planning
tools, and visual analytical dashboards in order to expedite the process and help
to optimize LOS seem appropriate.
CONCLUSIONS: HIT-based interventions have potential that may support better
management of processes related to patients' admission, hospitalization, and
discharge. However consistently evaluation along with using any new technology is
necessary.

The IMIA History project book we are co-editing with colleagues from the IMIA
History Working Group includes histories of early contributions to medical and
healthcare informatics, as described by a sample of pioneers and experts,
detailing how their own ideas developed from their work on various topics in the 
field at the beginnings of their contributions to the field. Its contents serve
as a preliminary guide for meta-analyses of how the different contributors state 
their personal interdisciplinary origins from today's perspectives. In this short
article we provide a brief preview of how an analysis of disciplinary
characteristics from individual histories can begin to shed light on processes of
interdisciplinary evolution of medical informatics in Europe.

Access to electronic medical record systems is limited in many medical
informatics education programs. The objective of this study was to inventory
open-source patient record systems with decision support capabilities, implement 
a system for educational use, and test the effect of the system on students'
learning. We sought systems that were under active development, with source code 
available, having an SQL-queryable database, and having decision support
capabilities. We identified 20 candidate electronic health record systems, of
which 6 mentioned decision support capabilities in their documentation. Of these,
the OpenMRS system appeared to meet all of the requirements for use in our
course; however, decision support capabilities needed to be added by use of a
custom module implementing Arden2Bytecode, an Arden Syntax interpreter. Students 
who used this system showed an improvement in their knowledge of decision support
systems and their capabilities. We conclude that there are a number of promising 
open-source electronic patient record systems currently under active development,
but decision support capabilities are still immature. We anticipate further
developments in this area in the coming years.

Anticipating unplanned hospital readmission episodes is a safety and
medico-economic issue. We compared statistics (Logistic Regression) and machine
learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Neural Network) for
predicting the risk of all-cause, 30-day hospital readmission using data from the
clinical data warehouse of Rennes and from other sources. The dataset included
hospital stays based on the criteria of the French national methodology for the
30-day readmission rate (i.e., patients older than 18 years, geolocation, no
iterative stays, and no hospitalization for palliative care), with a similar
pre-processing for all algorithms. We calculated the area under the ROC curve
(AUC) for 30-day readmission prediction by each model. In total, we included
259114 hospital stays, with a readmission rate of 8.8%. The AUC was 0.61 for the 
Logistic Regression, 0.69 for the Gradient Boosting, 0.69 for the Random Forest, 
and 0.62 for the Neural Network model. We obtained the best performance and
reproducibility to predict readmissions with Random Forest, and found that the
algorithms performed better when data came from different sources.

The amount of digital data derived from healthcare processes have increased
tremendously in the last years. This applies especially to unstructured data,
which are often hard to analyze due to the lack of available tools to process and
extract information. Natural language processing is often used in medicine, but
the majority of tools used by researchers are developed primarily for the English
language. For developing and testing natural language processing methods, it is
important to have a suitable corpus, specific to the medical domain that covers
the intended target language. To improve the potential of natural language
processing research, we developed tools to derive language specific medical
corpora from publicly available text sources. n order to extract
medicine-specific unstructured text data, openly available pub-lications from
biomedical journals were used in a four-step process: (1) medical journal
databases were scraped to download the articles, (2) the articles were parsed and
consolidated into a single repository, (3) the content of the repository was
de-scribed, and (4) the text data and the codes were released. In total, 93 969
articles were retrieved, with a word count of 83 868 501 in three different
languages (German, English, and Spanish) from two medical journal databases Our
results show that unstructured text data extraction from openly available medical
journal databases for the construction of unified corpora of medical text data
can be achieved through web scraping techniques.

Data integration is an important task in medical informatics and highly impacts
the gain out of existing health information data. These tasks are using
implemented as extract transform and load processes. By introducing HL7 FHIR as
an intermediate format, our aim was to integrate heterogeneous data from a German
pulmonary hypertension registry into an OMOP Common Data Model. First, domain
knowledge experts defined a common parameter set, which was subsequently mapped
to standardized terminologies like LOINC or SNOMED-CT. Data was extracted as HL7 
FHIR Bundle to be transformed to OMOP CDM by using XSLT. We successfully
transformed the majority of data elements to the OMOP CDM in a feasible time.

Grenoble Alpes University Hospital (CHUGA) is currently deploying a health data
warehouse called PREDIMED [1], a platform designed to integrate and analyze for
research, education and institutional management the data of patients treated at 
CHUGA. PREDIMED contains healthcare data, administrative data and, potentially,
data from external databases. PREDIMED is hosted by the CHUGA Information Systems
Department and benefits from its strict security rules. CHUGA's institutional
project PREDIMED aims to collaborate with similar projects in France and
worldwide. In this paper, we present how the data model defined to implement
PREDIMED at CHUGA is useful for medical experts to interactively build a cohort
of patients and to visualize this cohort.

Healthcare providers in the hospital setting must discuss patient information to 
ensure continuity of care and patient safety. This study explores how patients
perceive the information they hear discussed between healthcare providers and how
the concept of "eavesdropping" can be addressed by healthcare providers and in
the field of medical informatics. Using an inductive analysis of interviews with 
14 adult inpatients, research findings indicate that patients value receiving
information in the hospital setting, including information received through
eavesdropping. Patient eavesdropping opportunities include "eavesdropping by
design" events, such as during bedside shift changes and handoffs, as well as
unintended "unintended eavesdropping" events, such as listening to healthcare
provider conversations outside of the patient's room. Healthcare providers and
medical informaticists have opportunities to address eavesdropping in the
inpatient setting. Informatics systems that address "eavesdropping by design" and
"unintended eavesdropping opportunities" can improve patient-provider
communication and satisfy patient preferences for receiving medical information.

INTRODUCTION: The learning healthcare system (LHS) underpinned by data analysis
and feedback to clinical care providers is thought to improve quality of care.
The work aimed to implement an LHS for antibiotic prescribing in primary care in 
England.
METHOD: Deidentified patient-level data from general practices were processed and
analysed at regular intervals (fortnightly increments). A dashboard application
was developed and implemented displaying analytical graphics to give periodic
feedback to clinicians, tailored to each clinical site. Benchmarking parameters
were established by the analysis of two large national primary care datasets
allowing peer-to-peer comparisons. To date, the dashboard is available to 70
English practices.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful implementation and uptake of the secure technical LHS
infrastructure for the analysis and feedback to clinicians of their antibiotic
prescribing demonstrate a great appetite for this type of frequent prescribing
review in primary care, combining advanced data analytics with tailored feedback.

BACKGROUND: There is a shortage of medical informatics and data science platforms
using cloud computing on electronic medical record (EMR) data, and with computing
capacity for analyzing big data. We implemented, described, and applied a cloud
computing solution utilizing the fast health interoperability resources (FHIR)
standardization and state-of-the-art parallel distributed computing platform for 
advanced analytics.
METHODS: We utilized the architecture of the modern predictive analytics platform
called Cerner® HealtheDataLab and described the suite of cloud computing services
and Apache Projects that it relies on. We validated the platform by replicating
and improving on a previous single pediatric institution study/model on
readmission and developing a multi-center model of all-cause readmission for
pediatric-age patients using the Cerner® Health Facts Deidentified Database (now 
updated and referred to as the Cerner Real World Data). We retrieved a subset of 
1.4 million pediatric encounters consisting of 48 hospitals' data on pediatric
encounters in the database based on a priori inclusion criteria. We built and
analyzed corresponding random forest and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural
network models using HealtheDataLab.
RESULTS: Using the HealtheDataLab platform, we developed a random forest model
and multi-layer perceptron model with AUC of 0.8446 (0.8444, 0.8447) and 0.8451
(0.8449, 0.8453) respectively. We showed the distribution in model performance
across hospitals and identified a set of novel variables under previous resource 
utilization and generic medications that may be used to improve existing
readmission models.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high performance, elastic cloud computing
infrastructures such as the platform presented here can be used for the
development of highly predictive models on EMR data in a secure and robust
environment. This in turn can lead to new clinical insights/discoveries.

Objectives: Recently, wearable device technology has gained more popularity in
supporting a healthy lifestyle. Hence, researchers have begun to put significant 
efforts into studying the direct and indirect benefits of wearable devices for
health and wellbeing. This paper summarizes recent studies on the use of consumer
wearable devices to improve physical activity, mental health, and health
consciousness.
Methods: A thorough literature search was performed from several reputable
databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, arXiv, and bioRxiv mainly using
"wearable device research" as a keyword, no earlier than 2018. As a result, 25 of
the most recent and relevant papers included in this review cover several topics,
such as previous literature reviews (9 papers), wearable device accuracy (3
papers), self-reported data collection tools (3 papers), and wearable device
intervention (10 papers).
Results: All the chosen studies are discussed based on the wearable device used, 
complementary data, study design, and data processing method. All these previous 
studies indicate that wearable devices are used either to validate their benefits
for general wellbeing or for more serious medical contexts, such as
cardiovascular disorders and post-stroke treatment.
Conclusions: Despite their huge potential for adoption in clinical settings,
wearable device accuracy and validity remain the key challenge to be met. Some
lessons learned and future projections, such as combining traditional study
design with statistical and machine learning methods, are highlighted in this
paper to provide a useful overview for other researchers carrying out similar
research.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes affects 30.3 million people in the USA. Among these people, 
a major risk factor for microvascular complications is having a glycated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) value of ≥75 mmol/mol; therefore, it would be helpful to
identify patients who will obtain future HbA1c values of <75 mmol/mol.
OBJECTIVES: To develop and validate two prediction rules among patients with
diabetes having a baseline HbA1c value of ≥75 mmol/mol: (1) HbA1c measurement
ever <75 mmol/mol and (2) final HbA1c measurement of <75 mmol/mol.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using a registry extracting data from the
Department of Veterans Affairs's (VA's) electronic health records system.
Baseline was 1 Jul 2013-30 June 2014; patients were followed up until 31 July
2016.
RESULTS: Our population consisted of 145 659 patients. Across models, predictors 
were age, sex, minority status, baseline HbA1c value, time, HbA1c≥75 mmol/mol,
receiving insulin treatment and consecutive number of HbA1c values of
75 mmol/mol. The overall likelihood of a patient ever having an HbA1c<75 mmol/mol
was 73.65%; with the rule, predicted probabilities were 38.94%, 50.75% and
78.88%. The overall likelihood of patients having a final HbA1c measurement of
<75 mmol/mol was 55.35%; the rule provided predicted probabilities of 29.93%,
50.17% and 68.58%.
CONCLUSIONS: Within each rule, there were similar observed and predicted tertile 
probabilities; maintaining HbA1c values of <75 mmol/mol resulted in probability
shifts in the majority of patients. We recommend psychosocial screening for 15%
of patients for whom there is less than one-third chance of maintaining
HbA1c<75 mmol/mol. We plan to conduct additional research to see whether this
approach helps.

[Artificial intelligence-guided precision medicine in hematological disorders].

[Article in Japanese]

Author information:

Medical Science, The University of Tokyo.

Precision medicine in oncology uses genomic data to provide the right
intervention in the right patients at the right time. For this purpose,
next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an indispensable tool. However, further
innovations are necessary, including medical informatics which uses somatic
mutations to inform clinical intervention. This process, called manual
interpretation or curation, is currently labor-intensive, involving experienced
curators who identify the relevant evidence among a growing body of knowledge and
translate it into medical practice. To address this issue, since 2015, we have
been organizing a clinical sequencing (CS) team, which integrates clinical and
genomic information related to hematological malignancies with the aid of
artificial intelligence (AI). So far, we have collated AI-assisted CS data for
more than 300 patients with hematological cancers. In this paper, we provide a
brief introduction for the nonspecialist to the manual interpretation process
together with an overview of a representative AI platform, Watson for Genomics.
Based on our own experience, we highlight why AI is needed in the manual
interpretation process in CS. We also present some of the pitfalls and
limitations of AI that hematologists should be aware of when interpreting
AI-output.

BACKGROUND: IT systems in the healthcare field can have a marked sociotechnical
impact: they modify communication habits, alter clinical processes and may have
serious ethical implications. The introduction of such systems involves very
different groups of stakeholders because of the inherent multi-professionalism in
medicine and the role of patients and their relatives that are often
underrepresented. Each group contributes distinct perspectives and particular
needs, which create specific requirements for IT systems and may strongly
influence their acceptance and success. In the past, needs analysis, challenges
and requirements for medical IT systems have often been addressed using consensus
techniques such as the Delphi technique. Facing the heterogeneous spectrum of
stakeholders there is a need to develop these techniques further to control the
(strong) influence of the composition of the expert panel on the outcome and to
deal systematically with potentially incompatible needs of stakeholder groups.
This approach uses the strong advantages a Delphi study has, identifies the
disadvantages of traditional Delphi techniques and aims to introduce and evaluate
a modified approach called 360-Degree Delphi. Key aspects of 360-Degree Delphi
are tested by applying the approach to the needs and requirements analysis of a
system for managing patients' advance directives and living wills.
METHODS: 360-Degree Delphi (short 360°D), as a modified Delphi process, is
specified as a structured workflow with the optional use of stakeholder groups.
The approach redefines the composition of the expert panel by setting up groups
of different stakeholders. Consensus is created within individual stakeholder
groups, but is also communicated between groups, while the iterative structure of
the Delphi process remains unchanged. We hypothesize that (1) 360-Degree Delphi
yields complementary statements from different stakeholders, which would be lost 
in classical Delphi; while (2) the variation of statements within individual
stakeholder groups is lower than within the total collective. A user study is
performed that addresses five stakeholder groups (patients, relatives, medical
doctors, nurses and software developers) on the topic of living will
communication in an emergency context. Qualitative open questions are used in a
Delphi round 0. Answer texts are coded by independent raters who carry out
systematic bottom-up qualitative text analysis. Inter-rater reliability is
calculated and the resulting codes are used to test the hypotheses. Qualitative
results are transferred into quantitative questions and then surveyed in round 1.
The study took place in Germany.
RESULTS: About 25% of the invited experts (stakeholders) agreed to take part in
the Delphi round 0 (three patients, two relatives, three medical doctors, two
qualified nurses and three developers), forming a structured panel of the five
stakeholder groups. Two raters created a bottom-up coding, and 238 thematic codes
were identified by the qualitative text analysis. The inter-rater reliability
showed that 44.95% of the codes were semantically similar and coded for the same 
parts of the raw textual replies. Based on a consented coding list, a
quantitative online-questionnaire was developed and send to different stakeholder
groups. With respect to the hypotheses, Delphi round 0 had the following results:
(1) doctors had a completely different focus from all the other stakeholder
groups on possible channels of communications with the patient; (2) the
dispersion of codes within individual stakeholder groups and within the total
collective - visualized by box plots - was approximately 28% higher in the total 
collective than in the sub-collectives, but without a marked effect size. With
respect to the hypotheses, Delphi round 1 had the following results: different
stakeholder groups had highly diverging opinions with respect to central
questions on IT-development. For example, when asked to rate the importance of
access control against high availability of data (likert scale, 1 meaning
restrictive data access, 6 easy access to all data), patients (mean 4.862, Stdev 
+/- 1.866) and caregivers (mean 5.667, Stdev: +/- 0.816) highly favored data
availability, while relatives would restrict data access (mean 2.778, stdev
+/- 1.093). In comparison, the total group would not be representative of either 
of these individual stakeholder needs (mean 4.344, stdev +/- 1.870).
CONCLUSION: 360-Degree Delphi is feasible and allows different stakeholder groups
within an expert panel to reach agreement individually. Thus, it generates a more
detailed consensus which pays more tribute to individual stakeholders needs. This
has the potential to improve the time to consensus as well as to produce a more
representative and precise needs and requirements analysis. However, the method
may create new challenges for the IT development process, which will have to deal
with complementary or even contradictory statements from different stakeholder
groups.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the German Medical Informatics Initiative is to establish 
a national infrastructure for integrating and sharing health data. To this, Data 
Integration Centers are set up at university medical centers, which address data 
harmonization, information security and data protection. To capture patient
consent, a common informed consent template has been developed. It consists of
different modules addressing permissions for using data and biosamples. On the
technical level, a common digital representation of information from signed
consent templates is needed. As the partners in the initiative are free to adopt 
different solutions for managing consent information (e.g. IHE BPPC or HL7 FHIR
Consent Resources), we had to develop an interoperability layer.
METHODS: First, we compiled an overview of data items required to reflect the
information from the MII consent template as well as patient preferences and
derived permissions. Next, we created entity-relationship diagrams to formally
describe the conceptual data model underlying relevant items. We then compared
this data model to conceptual models describing representations of consent
information using different interoperability standards. We used the result of
this comparison to derive an interoperable representation that can be mapped to
common standards.
RESULTS: The digital representation needs to capture the following information:
(1) version of the consent, (2) consent status for each module, and (3) period of
validity of the status. We found that there is no generally accepted solution to 
represent status information in a manner interoperable with all relevant
standards. Hence, we developed a pragmatic solution, comprising codes which
describe combinations of modules with a basic set of status labels. We propose to
maintain these codes in a public registry called ART-DECOR. We present concrete
technical implementations of our approach using HL7 FHIR and IHE BPPC which are
also compatible with the open-source consent management software gICS.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed digital representation is (1) generic enough to capture
relevant information from a wide range of consent documents and data use
regulations and (2) interoperable with common technical standards. We plan to
extend our model to include more fine-grained status codes and rules for
automated access control.

BACKGROUND: In the era of information explosion, the use of the internet to
assist with clinical practice and diagnosis has become a cutting-edge area of
research. The application of medical informatics allows patients to be aware of
their clinical conditions, which may contribute toward the prevention of several 
chronic diseases and disorders.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we applied machine learning techniques to construct a
medical database system from electronic medical records (EMRs) of subjects who
have undergone health examination. This system aims to provide online self-health
evaluation to clinicians and patients worldwide, enabling personalized health and
preventive health.
METHODS: We built a medical database system based on the literature, and data
preprocessing and cleaning were performed for the database. We utilized both
supervised and unsupervised machine learning technology to analyze the EMR data
to establish prediction models. The models with EMR databases were then applied
to the internet platform.
RESULTS: The validation data were used to validate the online diagnosis
prediction system. The accuracy of the prediction model for metabolic syndrome
reached 91%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was 0.904 in this system. For chronic kidney disease, the prediction accuracy of 
the model reached 94.7%, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.982. In
addition, the system also provided disease diagnosis visualization via
clustering, allowing users to check their outcome compared with those in the
medical database, enabling increased awareness for a healthier lifestyle.
CONCLUSIONS: Our web-based health care machine learning system allowed users to
access online diagnosis predictions and provided a health examination report.
Users could understand and review their health status accordingly. In the future,
we aim to connect hospitals worldwide with our platform, so that health care
practitioners can make diagnoses or provide patient education to remote patients.
This platform can increase the value of preventive medicine and telemedicine.

BACKGROUND: The timeliness of detection of a sepsis incidence in progress is a
crucial factor in the outcome for the patient. Machine learning models built from
data in electronic health records can be used as an effective tool for improving 
this timeliness, but so far, the potential for clinical implementations has been 
largely limited to studies in intensive care units. This study will employ a
richer data set that will expand the applicability of these models beyond
intensive care units. Furthermore, we will circumvent several important
limitations that have been found in the literature: (1) Model evaluations neglect
the clinical consequences of a decision to start, or not start, an intervention
for sepsis. (2) Models are evaluated shortly before sepsis onset without
considering interventions already initiated. (3) Machine learning models are
built on a restricted set of clinical parameters, which are not necessarily
measured in all departments. (4) Model performance is limited by current
knowledge of sepsis, as feature interactions and time dependencies are hard-coded
into the model.
METHODS: In this study, we present a model to overcome these shortcomings using a
deep learning approach on a diverse multicenter data set. We used retrospective
data from multiple Danish hospitals over a seven-year period. Our sepsis
detection system is constructed as a combination of a convolutional neural
network and a long short-term memory network. We assess model quality by standard
concepts of accuracy as well as clinical usefulness, and we suggest a
retrospective assessment of interventions by looking at intravenous antibiotics
and blood cultures preceding the prediction time.
RESULTS: Results show performance ranging from AUROC 0.856 (3 h before sepsis
onset) to AUROC 0.756 (24 h before sepsis onset). Evaluating the clinical utility
of the model, we find that a large proportion of septic patients did not receive 
antibiotic treatment or blood culture at the time of the sepsis prediction, and
the model could, therefore, facilitate such interventions at an earlier point in 
time.
CONCLUSION: We present a deep learning system for early detection of sepsis that 
can learn characteristics of the key factors and interactions from the raw event 
sequence data itself, without relying on a labor-intensive feature extraction
work. Our system outperforms baseline models, such as gradient boosting, which
rely on specific data elements and therefore suffer from many missing values in
our dataset.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of
neuromuscular facial training in the rehabilitation of patients with facial
palsy. However, printed instructions for home training are often not of optimum
quality and associated with low adherence to therapy. Professional guidance,
e.g., by occupational therapists, is regarded as being of high quality, but is
associated with a high cost burden, particularly in chronic forms of disease.
OBJECTIVE: The idea to develop a smartphone app for facial training arose from
the above-described situation. The aim was to provide structured exercises for
the mimic muscles in the sense of neuromuscular training with visual feedback via
the front camera of the device.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A native app architecture in iOS was chosen to implement
the graphical and content-related concept. In the Apple Xcode (Apple, Cupertino, 
California, US) development environment, the app's code was written in the Swift 
programming language (Apple) and the graphical user interface was created.
RESULTS: An app prototype was implemented that provides step-by-step instructions
on selected mimic exercises via animated smileys. The duration and speed of the
exercise can be varied within a limited range. In the development environment,
the correct functionality of both physical and virtual devices was successfully
tested.
CONCLUSION: App-based facial training offers attractive opportunities to motivate
patients for improved adherence to treatment, which could hypothetically lead to 
a better outcome. Evaluation of this question is planned in a clinical trial
after completion of the development.

BACKGROUND: The inadequate follow-up of test results is a key patient safety
concern, carrying severe consequences for care outcomes. Patients discharged from
the emergency department are at particular risk of having test results pending at
discharge due to their short lengths of stay, with many hospitals acknowledging
that they do not have reliable systems for managing such results. Health
information technology hold the potential to reducing errors in the test result
management process. This study aimed to measure changes in the proportion of
acknowledged radiology reports pre and post introduction of an electronic result 
acknowledgement system and to determine the proportion of reports with abnormal
results, including clinically significant abnormal results requiring follow-up
action.
METHODS: A before and after study was conducted in the emergency department of a 
450-bed metropolitan teaching hospital in Australia. All radiology reports for
discharged patients for a one-month period before and after implementation of the
electronic result acknowledgement system were reviewed to determine; i) those
that reported abnormal results; ii) evidence of test result acknowledgement. All 
unacknowledged radiology results with an abnormal finding were assessed by an
independent panel of two senior emergency physicians for clinical significance.
RESULTS: Of 1654 radiology reports in the pre-implementation period 70.6%
(n = 1167) had documented evidence of acknowledgement by a clinician. For reports
with abnormal results, 71.6% (n = 396) were acknowledged. Of 157 unacknowledged
abnormal radiology reports reviewed by an independent emergency physician panel, 
34.4% (n = 54) were identified as clinically significant and 50% of these
(n = 27) were deemed to carry a moderate likelihood of patient morbidity if not
followed up. Electronic acknowledgement occurred for all radiology reports in the
post period (n = 1423), representing a 30.4% (95% CI: 28.1-32.6%) increase in
acknowledgement rate, and an increase of 28.4% (95% CI: 24.6-32.2%) for abnormal 
radiology results.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of health
information technology to improve the safety and effectiveness of the diagnostic 
process by increasing the rate of follow up of results pending at hospital
discharge.

The basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) model is composed of the input
vector, generator, and discriminator. Among them, the generator and discriminator
are implicit function expressions, usually implemented by deep neural networks.
GAN can learn the generative model of any data distribution through adversarial
methods with excellent performance. It has been widely applied to different areas
since it was proposed in 2014. In this review, we introduced the origin, specific
working principle, and development history of GAN, various applications of GAN in
digital image processing, Cycle-GAN, and its application in medical imaging
analysis, as well as the latest applications of GAN in medical informatics and
bioinformatics.

Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

Natural language processing (NLP) plays a vital role in modern medical
informatics. It converts narrative text or unstructured data into knowledge by
analyzing and extracting concepts. A comprehensive lexical system is the
foundation to the success of NLP applications and an essential component at the
beginning of the NLP pipeline. The SPECIALIST Lexicon and Lexical Tools,
distributed by the National Library of Medicine as one of the Unified Medical
Language System Knowledge Sources, provides an underlying resource for many NLP
applications. This article reports recent developments of 3 key components in the
Lexicon. The core NLP operation of Unified Medical Language System concept
mapping is used to illustrate the importance of these developments. Our objective
is to provide generic, broad coverage and a robust lexical system for NLP
applications. A novel multiword approach and other planned developments are
proposed.

BACKGROUND: Third-party electronic health record (EHR) apps allow health care
organizations to extend the capabilities and features of their EHR system. Given 
the widespread utilization of EHRs and the emergence of third-party apps in EHR
marketplaces, it has become necessary to conduct a systematic review and analysis
of apps in EHR app marketplaces.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review is to organize, categorize, and characterize
the availability of third-party apps in EHR marketplaces.
METHODS: Two informaticists (authors JR and BW) used grounded theory principles
to review and categorize EHR apps listed in top EHR vendors' public-facing
marketplaces.
RESULTS: We categorized a total of 471 EHR apps into a taxonomy consisting of 3
primary categories, 15 secondary categories, and 55 tertiary categories. The
three primary categories were administrative (n=203, 43.1%), provider support
(n=159, 33.8%), and patient care (n=109, 23.1%). Within administrative apps, we
split the apps into four secondary categories: front office (n=77, 37.9%),
financial (n=53, 26.1%), office administration (n=49, 24.1%), and office device
integration (n=17, 8.4%). Within the provider support primary classification, we 
split the apps into eight secondary categories: documentation (n=34, 21.3%),
records management (n=27, 17.0%), care coordination (n=23, 14.4%), population
health (n=18, 11.3%), EHR efficiency (n=16, 10.1%), ordering and prescribing
(n=15, 9.4%), medical device integration (n=13, 8.2%), and specialty EHR (n=12,
7.5%). Within the patient care primary classification, we split the apps into
three secondary categories: patient engagement (n=50, 45.9%), clinical decision
support (n=40, 36.7%), and remote care (n=18, 16.5%). Total app counts varied
substantially across EHR vendors. Overall, the distribution of apps across
primary categories were relatively similar, with a few exceptions.
CONCLUSIONS: We characterized and organized a diverse and rich set of third-party
EHR apps. This work provides an important reference for developers, researchers, 
and EHR customers to more easily search, review, and compare apps in EHR app
marketplaces.

We propose a machine learning driven approach to derive insights from
observational healthcare data to improve public health outcomes. Our goal is to
simultaneously identify patient subpopulations with differing health risks and to
find those risk factors within each subpopulation. We develop two supervised
mixture of experts models: a Supervised Gaussian Mixture model (SGMM) for general
features and a Supervised Bernoulli Mixture model (SBMM) tailored to binary
features. We demonstrate the two approaches on an analysis of high cost drivers
of Medicaid expenditures for inpatient stays. We focus on the three diagnostic
categories that accounted for the highest percentage of inpatient expenditures in
New York State (NYS) in 2016. When compared with state-of-the-art learning
methods (random forests, boosting, neural networks), our approaches provide
comparable prediction performance while also extracting insightful subpopulation 
structure and risk factors. For problems with binary features the proposed SBMM
provides as good or better performance than alternative methods while offering
insightful explanations. Our results indicate the promise of such approaches for 
extracting population health insights from electronic health care records.

BACKGROUND: Suboptimal use of antibiotics is a driver of antimicrobial resistance
(AMR). Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can assist prescribers with rapid
access to up-to-date information. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), the
introduction of CDSS for antibiotic prescribing could have a measurable impact.
However, interventions to implement them are challenging because of cultural and 
structural constraints, and their adoption and sustainability in routine clinical
care are often limited. Preimplementation research is needed to ensure relevant
adaptation and fit within the context of primary care in West Africa.
OBJECTIVE: This study examined the requirements for a CDSS adapted to the context
of primary care in West Africa, to analyze the barriers and facilitators of its
implementation and adaptation, and to ensure co-designed solutions for its
adaptation and sustainable use.
METHODS: We organized a workshop in Burkina Faso in June 2019 with 47 health care
professionals representing 9 West African countries and 6 medical specialties.
The workshop began with a presentation of Antibioclic, a publicly funded CDSS for
antibiotic prescribing in primary care that provides personalized antibiotic
recommendations for 37 infectious diseases. Antibioclic is freely available on
the web and as a smartphone app (iOS, Android). The presentation was followed by 
a roundtable discussion and completion of a questionnaire with open-ended
questions by participants. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic
analysis.
RESULTS: Most of the participants had access to a smartphone during their
clinical consultations (35/47, 74%), but only 49% (23/47) had access to a
computer and none used CDSS for antibiotic prescribing. The participants
considered that CDSS could have a number of benefits including updating the
knowledge of practitioners on antibiotic prescribing, improving clinical care and
reducing AMR, encouraging the establishment of national guidelines, and
developing surveillance capabilities in primary care. The most frequently
mentioned contextual barrier to implementing a CDSS was the potential risk of
increasing self-medication in West Africa, where antibiotics can be bought
without a prescription. The need for the CDSS to be tailored to the local
epidemiology of infectious diseases and AMR was highlighted along with the
availability of diagnostic tests and antibiotics using national guidelines where 
available. Participants endorsed co-design involving all stakeholders, including 
nurses, midwives, and pharmacists, as central to any introduction of CDSS. A
phased approach was suggested by initiating and evaluating CDSS at a pilot site, 
followed by dissemination using professional networks and social media. The lack 
of widespread internet access and computers could be circumvented by a mobile app
with an offline mode.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides valuable information for the development and
implementation of a CDSS for antibiotic prescribing among primary care
prescribers in LMICs and may, in turn, contribute to improving antibiotic use,
clinical outcomes and decreasing AMR.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge graph embedding is an effective semantic representation
method for entities and relations in knowledge graphs. Several translation-based 
algorithms, including TransE, TransH, TransR, TransD, and TranSparse, have been
proposed to learn effective embedding vectors from typical knowledge graphs in
which the relations between head and tail entities are deterministic. However, in
medical knowledge graphs, the relations between head and tail entities are
inherently probabilistic. This difference introduces a challenge in embedding
medical knowledge graphs.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to address the challenge of how to learn the probability
values of triplets into representation vectors by making enhancements to existing
TransX (where X is E, H, R, D, or Sparse) algorithms, including the following:
(1) constructing a mapping function between the score value and the probability, 
and (2) introducing probability-based loss of triplets into the original
margin-based loss function.
METHODS: We performed the proposed PrTransX algorithm on a medical knowledge
graph that we built from large-scale real-world electronic medical records data. 
We evaluated the embeddings using link prediction task.
RESULTS: Compared with the corresponding TransX algorithms, the proposed PrTransX
performed better than the TransX model in all evaluation indicators, achieving a 
higher proportion of corrected entities ranked in the top 10 and normalized
discounted cumulative gain of the top 10 predicted tail entities, and lower mean 
rank.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed PrTransX successfully incorporated the uncertainty of
the knowledge triplets into the embedding vectors.

Objectives: This study examined whether using electronic reminders leads to an
increase in the rate of diagnosis recordings in the electronic health record
system following visits to a general practitioner. The impact of electronic
reminders was studied in the primary health care of a Finnish city. Methods: This
observational quasi-experimental study based on a before-and-after design was
carried out by installing an electronic reminder to improve the recording of
diagnoses in the computerized electronic health record system. The quantity of
the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the intervention. The effect
of this intervention on the distribution of different diagnoses was also studied.
Results: Before intervention, 33%-46% of visits (to general practitioners/month) 
had recorded diagnose in the primary health care units. After 4 years, the
recording rate had risen to 87%-95% (p < 0.001). The rate of change in the
recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year of intervention and
plateaued about 3.5 years after application reminders. In the present study, most
of the visits concerned mild respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low
back pain and type 2 diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder is likely to
improve the recording of diagnoses during the visits to general practitioners.
The distribution of diagnoses was in line with former reports concerning
diagnoses in Finnish primary care.

7, 1081 BT Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the performance of two tools to help general practitioners
(GPs) identify patients in need of palliative care: the Surprise Question (SQ)
and the Supportive and Palliative Care Indicators Tool (SPICT).
METHODS: Prospective cohort study in two general practices in the Netherlands
with a size of 3640 patients. At the start of the study the GPs selected patients
by heart using the SQ. The SPICT was translated into a digital search in
electronic patient records. The GPs then selected patients from the list thus
created. Afterwards the GPs were interviewed about their experiences. The
following year a record was kept of all the patients deceased in both practices. 
We analysed the characteristics of the patients selected and the deceased. We
calculated the performance characteristics concerning predicting 1-year
mortality.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of the SQ was 50%, of the SPICT 57%; the specificity 99%
and 98%. When analysing the deceased (n = 36), 10 died relatively suddenly and
arguably could not be identified. Leaving out these 10, the sensitivity of the SQ
became 69%, of the SPICT 81%. The GPs found the performance of the digital search
quite time consuming.
CONCLUSION: The SPICT seems to be better in identifying patients in need of
palliative care than the SQ. It is also more time consuming than the SQ. However,
as the digital search can be performed more easily after it has been done for the
first time, initial investments can repay themselves.

PURPOSE: Using a 200 Head and Neck cancer (HNC) patient cohort, we employ patient
similarity based on tumor location, volume, and proximity to organs at risk to
predict radiation-associated dysphagia (RAD) in a new patient receiving intensity
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients were treated using curative-intent IMRT.
Anatomical features were extracted from contrast-enhanced tomography scans
acquired pre-treatment. Patient similarity was computed using a topological
similarity measure, which allowed for the prediction of normal tissues' mean
doses. We performed feature selection and clustering, and used the resulting
groups of patients to forecast RAD. We used Logistic Regression (LG)
cross-validation to assess the potential toxicity risk of these groupings.
RESULTS: Out of 200 patients, 34 patients were recorded as having RAD. Patient
clusters were significantly correlated with RAD (p < .0001). The area under the
receiver-operator curve (AUC) using pre-established, baseline features gave a
predictive accuracy of 0.79, while the addition of our cluster labels improved
accuracy to 0.84.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that spatial information available pre-treatment can
be used to robustly identify groups of RAD high-risk patients. We identify
feature sets that considerably improve toxicity risk prediction beyond what is
possible using baseline features. Our results also suggest that similarity-based 
predicted mean doses to organs can be used as valid predictors of risk to organs.

PURPOSE: To determine whether computed tomography radiation dose data could be
captured electronically across hospitals to derive regional diagnostic reference 
levels for quality improvement.
METHODS: Data on consecutive computed tomography examinations from 8 hospitals
were collected automatically in a central database (Repository) from April 2017
to September 2017. The most frequently performed examinations were used to
determine the standard protocols for each hospital. Diagnostic reference levels
across hospitals were derived using statistical distribution for 2 radiation dose
metrics. These values were compared between hospitals, within and between
hospitals by scanner and against national Health Canada achievable doses and
diagnostic reference levels.
RESULTS: Three master protocol groups, Head, Abdomen-Pelvis, and
Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis, accounted for 43% of all valid studies (N = 40 277). For
the Repository, 11 of 12 mean values and 75th percentile diagnostic reference
levels were below the Health Canada mean and 75th percentile values, and one was 
the same as the Health Canada value. Mean radiation dose by protocol varied by as
much as 97% between hospitals. There was no consistent pattern in the difference 
between mean doses between large and small hospitals.
CONCLUSION: This electronic data acquisition process could be used to continually
update achievable doses for frequently used computed tomography examinations in
Ontario and eliminate the need for nationwide manual surveys. Results compared
across institutions will allow hospitals to maintain achievable doses and lower
patient exposure.

INTRODUCTION: There is consistent evidence that the workload in general practices
is substantially increasing. The digitalisation of healthcare including the use
of artificial intelligence has been suggested as a solution to this problem. We
wanted to explore the features of intelligent online triage tools in primary care
by conducting a literature review.
METHOD: A systematic literature search strategy was formulated and conducted in
the PubMed database and the Cochrane Library. Articles were selected according to
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results and data were systematically extracted and 
thematically analysed. 17 articles of that reported large multimethod studies or 
smaller diagnostic accuracy tests on clinical vignettes were included. Reviews
and expert opinions were also considered.
RESULTS: There was limited evidence on the actual effects and performance of
triage tools in primary care. Several aspects can guide further development:
concepts of system design, system implementation and diagnostic performance. The 
most important findings were: a need to formulate evaluation guidelines and
regulations; their assumed potential has not yet been met; a risk of increased or
redistribution of workloads and the available symptom checker systems seem overly
risk averse and should be tested in real-life settings.
CONCLUSION: This review identified several features associated with the design
and implementation of intelligent online triage tools in a primary care context, 
although most of the investigated systems seemed underdeveloped and offered
limited benefits. Current online triage systems should not be used by individuals
who have reasonable access to traditional healthcare. Systems used should be
strictly evaluated and regulated like other medical products.

With progress in information and communication technology, medical information
has been converted to digital formats and stored and managed using computer
systems. The construction, management, and operation of medical information
systems and regional medical liaison systems are the main components of the
clinical tasks of medical informatics departments. Research using medical
information accumulated in these systems is also a task for medical informatics
department. Recently, medical real-world data (RWD) accumulated in medical
information systems has become a focus not only for primary use but also for
secondary uses of medical information. However, there are many problems, such as 
standardization, collection, cleaning, and analysis of them. The internet of
things and artificial intelligence are also being applied in the collection and
analysis of RWD and in resolving the above problems. Using these new
technologies, progress in medical care and clinical research is about to enter a 
new era. J. Med. Invest. 67 : 27-29, February, 2020.

BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis and septic shock are among the leading causes of death 
in the USA. While early prediction of severe sepsis can reduce adverse patient
outcomes, sepsis remains one of the most expensive conditions to diagnose and
treat.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a machine
learning algorithm for severe sepsis prediction on in-hospital mortality,
hospital length of stay and 30-day readmission.
DESIGN: Prospective clinical outcomes evaluation.
SETTING: Evaluation was performed on a multiyear, multicentre clinical data set
of real-world data containing 75 147 patient encounters from nine hospitals
across the continental USA, ranging from community hospitals to large academic
medical centres.
PARTICIPANTS: Analyses were performed for 17 758 adult patients who met two or
more systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria at any point during their
stay ('sepsis-related' patients).
INTERVENTIONS: Machine learning algorithm for severe sepsis prediction.
OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality, length of stay and 30-day readmission
rates.
RESULTS: Hospitals saw an average 39.5% reduction of in-hospital mortality, a
32.3% reduction in hospital length of stay and a 22.7% reduction in 30-day
readmission rate for sepsis-related patient stays when using the machine learning
algorithm in clinical outcomes analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Reductions of in-hospital mortality, hospital length of stay and
30-day readmissions were observed in real-world clinical use of the machine
learning-based algorithm. The predictive algorithm may be successfully used to
improve sepsis-related outcomes in live clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications, including infections, are highly prevalent
in patients after hematopoietic cell transplantation with chronic graft-vs-host
disease. These comorbid diseases can make the diagnosis of early lung
graft-vs-host disease (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) challenging. A
quantitative method to differentiate among these pulmonary diseases can address
diagnostic challenges and facilitate earlier and more targeted therapy.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a single-center study of 66 patients with 
CT chest scans analyzed with a quantitative imaging tool known as parametric
response mapping. Parametric response mapping results were correlated with
pulmonary function tests and clinical characteristics. Five parametric response
mapping metrics were applied to K-means clustering and support vector machine
models to distinguish among posttransplantation lung complications solely from
quantitative output.
RESULTS: Compared with parametric response mapping, spirometry showed a moderate 
correlation with radiographic air trapping, and total lung capacity and residual 
volume showed a strong correlation with radiographic lung volumes. K-means
clustering analysis distinguished four unique clusters. Clusters 2 and 3
represented obstructive physiology (encompassing 81% of patients with
bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) in increasing severity (percentage air
trapping 15.6% and 43.0%, respectively). Cluster 1 was dominated by normal lung, 
and cluster 4 was characterized by patients with parenchymal opacities. A support
vector machine algorithm differentiated bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with a 
specificity of 88%, sensitivity of 83%, accuracy of 86%, and an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85.
INTERPRETATION: Our machine learning models offer a quantitative approach for the
identification of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome vs other lung diseases,
including late pulmonary complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Generative Participatory Design Methodology to Develop Electronic Health
Interventions: Systematic Literature Review.

Netherlands.

BACKGROUND: Generative participatory design (PD) may help in developing
electronic health (eHealth) interventions. PD is characterized by the involvement
of all stakeholders in creative activities. This is different from the
traditional user-centered design, where users are less involved. When looking at 
PD from a research through design perspective, it is important to summarize the
reasons for choosing a certain form of generative PD to further develop its
methodology. However, the scientific literature is currently unclear about which 
forms of PD are used to develop eHealth and which arguments are used to
substantiate the decision to use a certain form of generative PD.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the reporting and substantiation of
generative PD methodologies in empirical eHealth studies published in scientific 
journals to further develop PD methodology in the field of eHealth.
METHODS: A systematic literature review following the Cochrane guidelines was
conducted in several databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL 
EBSCOhost). Data were extracted on the recruitment and management of
stakeholders, the use of tools, and the use of outcome measures.
RESULTS: Of the 3131 studies initially identified, 69 were selected for
qualitative synthesis. The reporting was very variable, depending to a large
extent on whether the study stated that reporting on the PD process was a major
aim. The different levels of reporting and substantiation of the choices of a
recruitment strategy, stakeholder management, and tools and outcome measures are 
presented. Only a few authors explicitly used arguments directly related to PD
guiding principles such as democratic, mutual learning, tacit and latent
knowledge, and collective creativity. Even though PD principles were not always
explicitly discussed in the method descriptions of the studies, they were
implicitly present, mostly in the descriptions of the use of PD tools. The
arguments used to substantiate the choices made in stakeholder management, PD
tools, and the type of outcome measures adopted point to the involvement of PD
principles.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies that have used a PD research methodology to develop eHealth 
primarily substantiate the choice of tools made and much less the use of
stakeholders and outcome measures.

The need for e-mental health (electronic mental health) services in Canada is
significant. The current mental health care delivery models primarily require
people to access services in person with a health professional. Given the large
number of people requiring mental health care in Canada, this model of care
delivery is not sufficient in its current form. E-mental health technologies may 
offer an important solution to the problem. This topic was discussed in greater
depth at the 9th Annual Canadian E-Mental Health Conference held in Toronto,
Canada. Themes that emerged from the discussions at the conference include (1)
the importance of trust, transparency, human centeredness, and compassion in the 
development and delivery of digital mental health technologies; (2) an emphasis
on equity, diversity, inclusion, and access when implementing e-mental health
services; (3) the need to ensure that the mental health workforce is able to
engage in a digital way of working; and (4) co-production of e-mental health
services among a diverse stakeholder group becoming the standard way of working.

Rock, USA.

Instruction is a competency included in the Medical Library Association's list of
professional competencies for health sciences librarians, and is often included
in many job requirements in this field. However, few opportunities for formal
training are available, leaving most librarians to learn how to teach effectively
on the job. This column examines some of the literature surrounding pedagogy for 
medical informatics librarians and invites readers to identify their needs for
training as instruction librarians via an informal survey.

DDX3X is Epigenetically Repressed in Renal Cell Carcinoma and Serves as a
Prognostic Indicator and Therapeutic Target in Cancer Progression.

Lin TC(1).

Author information:

Taiwan.

DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 3, X-linked (DDX3X) is a member of the
DEAD-box family of RNA helicases whose function has been revealed to be involved 
in RNA metabolism. Recent studies further indicate the abnormal expression in
pan-cancers and the relevant biological effects on modulating cancer progression.
However, DDX3X's role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) progression remains largely
unknown. In this study, a medical informatics-based analysis using The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was performed to evaluate clinical prognoses related 
to DDX3X. The results suggest that DDX3X is epigenetically repressed in tumor
tissue and that lower DDX3X is correlated with the poor overall survival of RCC
patients and high tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis (TNM 
staging system). Furthermore, knowledge-based transcriptomic analysis by
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that the SPINK1-metallothionein pathway
is a top 1-repressed canonical signaling pathway by DDX3X. Furthermore, SPINK1
and the metallothionein gene family all serve as poor prognostic indicators, and 
the expression levels of those genes are inversely correlated with DDX3X in RCC. 
Furthermore, digoxin was identified via Connectivity Map analysis (L1000) for its
capability to reverse gene signatures in patients with low DDX3X. Importantly,
cancer cell proliferation and migration were decreased upon digoxin treatment in 
RCC cells. The results of this study indicate the significance of the
DDX3Xlow/SPINK1high/metallothioneinhigh axis for predicting poor survival outcome
in RCC patients and suggest digoxin as a precise and personalized compound for
curing those patients with low DDX3X expression levels.

Structured reporting is a favorable and sustainable form of reporting in
radiology. Among its advantages are better presentation, clearer nomenclature,
and higher quality. By using MRRT-compliant templates, the content of the
categorized items (e.g., select fields) can be automatically stored in a
database, which allows further research and quality analytics based on
established ontologies like RadLex® linked to the items. Additionally, it is
relevant to provide free-text input for descriptions of findings and impressions 
in complex imaging studies or for the information included with the clinical
referral. So far, however, this unstructured content cannot be categorized. We
developed a solution to analyze and code these free-text parts of the templates
in our MRRT-compliant reporting platform, using natural language processing (NLP)
with RadLex® terms in addition to the already categorized items. The established 
hybrid reporting concept is working successfully. The NLP tool provides RadLex®
codes with modifiers (affirmed, speculated, negated). Radiologists can confirm or
reject codes provided by NLP before finalizing the structured report.
Furthermore, users can suggest RadLex® codes from free text that is not correctly
coded with NLP or can suggest to change the modifier. Analyzing free-text fields 
took 1.23 s on average. Hybrid reporting enables coding of free-text information 
in our MRRT-compliant templates and thus increases the amount of categorized data
that can be stored in the database. This enhances the possibilities for further
analyses, such as correlating clinical information with radiological findings or 
storing high-quality structured information for machine-learning approaches.

Greater transparency in salaries overall and in factors associated with differing
salaries can help students and professionals plan their careers, discover biases 
and obstacles, and help advance professional disciplines broadly. In March 2018, 
we conducted the first salary survey of American Medical Informatics Association 
members. Our goal was to summarize salary information and provide a nuanced view 
pertaining to the diverse biomedical informatics community. To identify factors
associated with higher salaries, we reviewed average salaries for different
groups (physician status, academic status, and different leadership positions) by
gender. We also fitted multiple linear regression models for all participants (N 
= 201) and for gender, physician- and academic-status subgroup. The mean
(standard deviation) salary was $181,774 ($99,566). Men earned more than women on
average, and especially among professionals from academic settings. More years
working in informatics and full-time employment were two factors that were
consistently associated with higher salary.

OBJECTIVE: Most diseases result from the complex interplay between genetic and
environmental factors. The exposome can be defined as a systematic approach to
acquire large data sets corresponding to environmental exposures of an individual
along her/ his life. The objective of this contribution is to raise awareness
within the health informatics community about the importance of dealing with data
related to the contribution of environmental factors to individual health,
particularly in the context of precision medicine informatics.
METHODS: This article summarizes the main findings after a panel organized by the
International Medical Informatics Association - Exposome Informatics Working
Group held during the last MEDINFO, in Lyon (France) in August 2019.
RESULTS: The members of our community presented four initiatives (PULSE, Digital 
exposome, Cloudy with a chance of pain, Wearable clinics), providing a detailed
view of current challenges and accomplishments in processing environmental and
social data from a health research perspective. Projects illustrate a wide range 
of research methods, digital data collection technologies, and analytics and
visualization tools. This reinforces the idea that this area is now ready for
health informaticians to step in and contribute their expertise, leading the
application of informatics strategies to understand environmental health
problems.
CONCLUSIONS: The featured projects illustrate applications that use exposome data
for the investigation of the causes of diseases, health care, patient
empowerment, and public health. They offer a rich overview of the expanding range
of applications that informatics is finding in the field of environmental health,
with potential impact in precision medicine.

OBJECTIVE: To create practical recommendations for the curation of routinely
collected health data and artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care with a
focus on ensuring their ethical use.
METHODS: We defined data curation as the process of management of data throughout
its lifecycle to ensure it can be used into the future. We used a literature
review and Delphi exercises to capture insights from the Primary Care Informatics
Working Group (PCIWG) of the International Medical Informatics Association
(IMIA).
RESULTS: We created six recommendations: (1) Ensure consent and formal process to
govern access and sharing throughout the data life cycle; (2) Sustainable data
creation/collection requires trust and permission; (3) Pay attention to
Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as they may have unrecognised risks; (4)
Integrate data governance and data quality management to support clinical
practice in integrated care systems; (5) Recognise the need for new processes to 
address the ethical issues arising from AI in primary care; (6) Apply an ethical 
framework mapped to the data life cycle, including an assessment of data quality 
to achieve effective data curation.
CONCLUSIONS: The ethical use of data needs to be integrated within the curation
process, hence running throughout the data lifecycle. Current information systems
may not fully detect the risks associated with ETL and AI; they need careful
scrutiny. With distributed integrated care systems where data are often used
remote from documentation, harmonised data quality assessment, management, and
governance is important. These recommendations should help maintain trust and
connectedness in contemporary information systems and planned developments.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to
the global health care system. Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance
efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics
technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development
and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 
in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China.
METHODS: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization,
and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a
case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social
media on mobile devices.
RESULTS: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile
devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and
prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic 
surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 
people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic
emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to 
improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the
statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical
effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which
warrants further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide
useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud
technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this
real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.

Blood pressure (BP) variability is one of the important risk factors of
cardiovascular disease (CVD). "Surge BP," which represents short-term BP
variability, is defined as pathological exaggerated BP increase capable of
triggering cardiovascular events. Surge BP is effectively evaluated by our new BP
monitoring device. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to develop an
algorithm for the automatic detection of surge BP from continuous "beat-by-beat" 
(BbB) BP measurements. It enables clinicians to save significant time identifying
surge BP in big data from their patients' continuous BbB BP measurements. A total
of 94 subjects (74 males and 20 females) participated in our study to develop the
surge BP detection algorithm, resulting in a total of 3272 surges collected from 
the study subjects. The surge BP detection algorithm is a simple classification
model based on supervised learning which formulates shape of surge BP as
detection rules. Surge BP identified with our algorithm was evaluated against
surge BP manually labeled by experts with 5-fold cross validation. The recall and
precision of the algorithm were 0.90 and 0.64, respectively. Processing time on
each subject was 11.0 ± 4.7 s. Our algorithm is adequate for use in clinical
practice and will be helpful in efforts to better understand this unique aspect
of the onset of CVD. Graphical abstract Surge blood pressure (surge BP) which is 
defined as pathological short-term (several tens of seconds) exaggerated BP
increase capable of triggering cardiovascular events. We have already developed a
wearable continuous beat-by-beat (bBb) BP monitoring device and observed surge
BPs successfully in obstructive sleep apnea patients. In this, we developed an
algorithm for the automatic detection of surge BP from continuous BbB BP
measurements to save significant time identifying surge BP among > 30,000 BbB BP 
measurements. Our result shows this algorithm can correctly detect surge BPs with
a recall of over 0.9.

BACKGROUND: In the past 20 years, various methods have been introduced to
construct disease networks. However, established disease networks have not been
clinically useful to date because of differences among demographic factors, as
well as the temporal order and intensity among disease-disease associations.
OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the overall patterns of the
associations among diseases; network properties, such as clustering, degree, and 
strength; and the relationship between the structure of disease networks and
demographic factors.
METHODS: We used National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort
(NHIS-NSC) data from the Republic of Korea, which included the time series
insurance information of 1 million out of 50 million Korean (approximately 2%)
patients obtained between 2002 and 2013. After setting the observation and
outcome periods, we selected only 520 common Korean Classification of Disease,
sixth revision codes that were the most prevalent diagnoses, making up
approximately 80% of the cases, for statistical validity. Using these data, we
constructed a directional and weighted temporal network that considered both
demographic factors and network properties.
RESULTS: Our disease network contained 294 nodes and 3085 edges, a relative risk 
value of more than 4, and a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of <.001.
Interestingly, our network presented four large clusters. Analysis of the network
topology revealed a stronger correlation between in-strength and out-strength
than between in-degree and out-degree. Further, the mean age of each disease
population was related to the position along the regression line of the
out/in-strength plot. Conversely, clustering analysis suggested that our network 
boasted four large clusters with different sex, age, and disease categories.
CONCLUSIONS: We constructed a directional and weighted disease network
visualizing demographic factors. Our proposed disease network model is expected
to be a valuable tool for use by early clinical researchers seeking to explore
the relationships among diseases in the future.

PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to design and implement a novel, universally
offered, computerized clinical decision support (CDS) gonorrhea and chlamydia
(GC/CT) screening tool embedded in the emergency department (ED) clinical
workflow and triggered by patient-entered data.
METHODS: The study consisted of the design and implementation of a tablet-based
screening tool based on qualitative data of adolescent and parent/guardian
acceptability of GC/CT screening in the ED and an advisory committee of ED
leaders and end users. The tablet was offered to adolescents aged 14-21 years and
informed patients of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention GC/CT screening
recommendations, described the testing process, and assessed whether patients
agreed to testing. The tool linked to CDS that streamlined the order entry
process. The primary outcome was the patient capture rate (proportion of patients
with tablet data recorded). The secondary outcomes included rates of patient
agreement to GC/CT testing and provider acceptance of the CDS.
RESULTS: Outcomes at the main and satellite EDs, respectively, were as follows:
1-year patient capture rates were 64.6% and 64.5%; 9.9% and 4.4% of patients
agreed to GC/CT testing, and of those, the provider ordered testing for 73% and
72%.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of this computerized screening tool embedded in the
clinical workflow resulted in patient capture rates of almost two-thirds and
clinician CDS acceptance rates >70% with limited patient agreement to testing.
This screening tool is a promising method for confidential GC/CT screening among 
youth in an ED setting. Additional interventions are needed to increase
adolescent agreement for GC/CT testing.

INTRODUCTION: The HAISS (Herramienta de Aprendizaje ISS) program was created to
enhance the feasibility and learning of trauma severity scores AIS (Abbreviated
Injury Score) and ISS (Injury Severity Score).
OBJECTIVE: Get a computer tool that promotes learning and facilitate proper use
of AIS and ISS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample of 40 orthopedic residents from 1st to 4th grade
from 4 hospitals of the Ministry of Health was taken. A prospective longitudinal 
study was conducted with analytical statistics. 10 clinical cases for obtaining
ISS by AIS score were delivered, this was done with the AIS Manual 2005 update
2008, two questions were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and ease of use,
the time to perform was measured. The process was repeated a month later with the
HAISS program.
RESULTS: Using the HAISS program reduced the time to resolve the 10 cases by more
than 50%, acceptance by the user of the AIS scale also improved. Reliability to
obtain the codification of lesions with AIS did not improve, but it did not
affected ISS.
CONCLUSIONS: The HAISS computer program is useful for orthopedic residents to
accept the AIS score and ISS score mainly because it improved the ease of use and
makes it more user-friendly, it also takes less time to use it.

Previous epidemic management research proves the importance of city-level
information, but also highlights limited expertise in urban data applications
during a pandemic outbreak. In this paper, we provide an overview of city-level
information, in combination with analytical and operational capacity, that define
urban intelligence for supporting response to disease outbreaks. We present five 
components (movement, facilities, people, information, and engagement) that have 
been previously investigated but remain siloed to successfully orchestrate an
integrated pandemic response. Reflecting on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
outbreak that was first identified in Wuhan, China, we discuss the opportunities,
technical challenges, and foreseeable controversies for deploying urban
intelligence during a pandemic. Finally, we emphasize the urgency of building
urban intelligence through cross-disciplinary research and collaborative practice
on a global scale.

BACKGROUND: Medication adherence in asthma and COPD is notoriously low. To
intervene effectively, family physicians need to assess adherence accurately,
which is a challenging endeavor. In collaboration family physicians and
individuals with asthma or COPD, we aimed to explore the barriers and
facilitators of assessing medication adherence in clinical practice (exploratory 
phase), and to develop a novel web-based tool (e-MEDRESP) that will allow
physicians to monitor adherence using pharmacy claims data (development phase).
METHODS: We used qualitative research methods and a framework inspired by
user-centered design principles. Five focus groups were held: 2 with subjects (n 
= 15) and 3 with physicians (n = 20), and 10 individual interviews were conducted
with physicians. In the exploratory phase, data were analyzed using thematic
networks. In the development phase, we identified components to be included in an
e-MEDRESP prototype through an iterative approach. The web-based e-MEDRESP tool
was constructed by applying algorithms to pharmacy claims data that reflected
end-users' recommendations through an informatics approach designed for
electronic medical records.
RESULTS: The main barriers to assessing medication adherence included a lack of
objective information regarding medication use and short duration of medical
visits. Physicians emphasized that identifying patients at risk for nonadherence 
requires a team effort from pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and nurses.
Subjects also agreed that the use of easily interpretable pharmacy claims data
could be an important facilitator and contributed to the development of the
e-MEDRESP prototype, which contains graphical representations of the adherence to
respiratory controller medications and dispensing of rescue medications.
CONCLUSIONS: The e-MEDRESP tool has the potential to allow physicians to measure 
adherence objectively and to facilitate patient-physician communication
concerning medication use. Future studies are needed to evaluate the feasibility 
of implementing e-MEDRESP in clinical practice. It would be relevant to develop
strategies that could facilitate the sharing of information presented in
e-MEDRESP among primary care health professionals.

INTRODUCTION: As the health system seeks to leverage large-scale data to inform
population outcomes, the informatics community is developing tools for analysing 
these data. To support data quality assessment within such a tool, we extended
the open-source software Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics
(OHDSI) to incorporate new functions useful for population health.
METHODS: We developed and tested methods to measure the completeness, timeliness 
and entropy of information. The new data quality methods were applied to over
100 million clinical messages received from emergency department information
systems for use in public health syndromic surveillance systems.
DISCUSSION: While completeness and entropy methods were implemented by the OHDSI 
community, timeliness was not adopted as its context did not fit with the
existing OHDSI domains. The case report examines the process and reasons for
acceptance and rejection of ideas proposed to an open-source community like
OHDSI.

BACKGROUND: Clinical narratives represent the main form of communication within
health care, providing a personalized account of patient history and assessments,
and offering rich information for clinical decision making. Natural language
processing (NLP) has repeatedly demonstrated its feasibility to unlock evidence
buried in clinical narratives. Machine learning can facilitate rapid development 
of NLP tools by leveraging large amounts of text data.
OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to provide systematic evidence on the
properties of text data used to train machine learning approaches to clinical
NLP. We also investigated the types of NLP tasks that have been supported by
machine learning and how they can be applied in clinical practice.
METHODS: Our methodology was based on the guidelines for performing systematic
reviews. In August 2018, we used PubMed, a multifaceted interface, to perform a
literature search against MEDLINE. We identified 110 relevant studies and
extracted information about text data used to support machine learning, NLP tasks
supported, and their clinical applications. The data properties considered
included their size, provenance, collection methods, annotation, and any relevant
statistics.
RESULTS: The majority of datasets used to train machine learning models included 
only hundreds or thousands of documents. Only 10 studies used tens of thousands
of documents, with a handful of studies utilizing more. Relatively small datasets
were utilized for training even when much larger datasets were available. The
main reason for such poor data utilization is the annotation bottleneck faced by 
supervised machine learning algorithms. Active learning was explored to
iteratively sample a subset of data for manual annotation as a strategy for
minimizing the annotation effort while maximizing the predictive performance of
the model. Supervised learning was successfully used where clinical codes
integrated with free-text notes into electronic health records were utilized as
class labels. Similarly, distant supervision was used to utilize an existing
knowledge base to automatically annotate raw text. Where manual annotation was
unavoidable, crowdsourcing was explored, but it remains unsuitable because of the
sensitive nature of data considered. Besides the small volume, training data were
typically sourced from a small number of institutions, thus offering no hard
evidence about the transferability of machine learning models. The majority of
studies focused on text classification. Most commonly, the classification results
were used to support phenotyping, prognosis, care improvement, resource
management, and surveillance.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified the data annotation bottleneck as one of the key
obstacles to machine learning approaches in clinical NLP. Active learning and
distant supervision were explored as a way of saving the annotation efforts.
Future research in this field would benefit from alternatives such as data
augmentation and transfer learning, or unsupervised learning, which do not
require data annotation.

Objective: In recent years, the use of information and communication technologies
(ICTs) has increased in various sectors, among which the healthcare service is no
exception. However, studies have mostly focused on the use of ICTs among patients
with chronic diseases, with few reports on the advantages and barriers of these
technologies among physicians, particularly in Latin America. We designed this
study to fill in the gap, as an objective assessment of the frequency of use,
perceptions, and barriers of ICTs among physicians remains crucial for a
successful implementation of these technologies into the mainstream medical
practice.
Methods: We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional survey-based study in 640
Ecuadorian physicians. The survey used consisted of 13 items and evaluated the
frequency of use, perceptions, and barriers of ICTs among physicians. Chi-square 
tests for goodness of fit and independence were performed, whilst Phi coefficient
was interpreted to assess the strength of associations. Fisher exact test was
performed when required.
Results: Over 90% of physicians reported the use of ICTs to message other
colleagues and patients (p=0.000). While 89.5% of physicians used social media to
interact with other colleagues, only 58.1% used them to interact with patients
(p=0.000). Most participants reported the use of ICTs to search for academic
information (p=0.000). Moreover, more than 80.0% agree that ICTs may be used to
promote health and medical services, search new job opportunities, get involved
in research projects and promote teamwork with colleagues. However, 83.6% of
physicians expressed concerns about privacy and patient confidentiality, while
53.8% stated that they lacked the time to use ICTs.
Conclusion: High usage of ICTs was found among Ecuadorian physicians. Younger
physicians, with less postgraduate years, and non-specialists were more likely to
have a positive perception toward ICTs. Privacy and patient confidentiality,
followed by time management, were the most reported barriers in our study.

Insurance Customers' Expectations for Sharing Health Data: Qualitative Survey
Study.

Oulu, Oulu, Finland.

BACKGROUND: Insurance organizations are essential stakeholders in health care
ecosystems. For addressing future health care needs, insurance companies require 
access to health data to deliver preventative and proactive digital health
services to customers. However, extant research is limited in examining the
conditions that incentivize health data sharing.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) identify the expectations of insurance
customers when sharing health data, (2) determine the perceived intrinsic value
of health data, and (3) explore the conditions that aid in incentivizing health
data sharing in the relationship between an insurance organization and its
customer.
METHODS: A Web-based survey was distributed to randomly selected customers from a
Finnish insurance organization through email. A single open-text answer was used 
for a qualitative data analysis through inductive coding, followed by a thematic 
analysis. Furthermore, the 4 constructs of commitment, power, reciprocity, and
trust from the social exchange theory (SET) were applied as a framework.
RESULTS: From the 5000 customers invited to participate, we received 452 surveys 
(response rate: 9.0%). Customer characteristics were found to reflect customer
demographics. Of the 452 surveys, 48 (10.6%) open-text responses were skipped by 
the customer, 57 (12.6%) customers had no expectations from sharing health data, 
and 44 (9.7%) customers preferred to abstain from a data sharing relationship.
Using the SET framework, we found that customers expected different conditions to
be fulfilled by their insurance provider based on the commitment, power,
reciprocity, and trust constructs. Of the 452 customers who completed the
surveys, 64 (14.2%) customers required that the insurance organization meets
their data treatment expectations (commitment). Overall, 4.9% (22/452) of
customers were concerned about their health data being used against them to
profile their health, to increase insurance prices, or to deny health insurance
claims (power). A total of 28.5% (129/452) of customers expected some form of
benefit, such as personalized digital health services, and 29.9% (135/452) of
customers expected finance-related compensation (reciprocity). Furthermore, 7.5% 
(34/452) of customers expected some form of empathy from the insurance
organization through enhanced transparency or an emotional connection (trust).
CONCLUSIONS: To aid in the design and development of digital health services,
insurance organizations need to address the customers' expectations when sharing 
their health data. We established the expectations of customers in the social
exchange of health data and explored the perceived values of data as intangible
goods. Actions by the insurance organization should aim to increase trust through
a culture of transparency, commitment to treat health data in a prescribed
manner, provide reciprocal benefits through digital health services that
customers deem valuable, and assuage fears of health data being used to prevent
providing insurance coverage or increase costs.

Introduction: Dissemination benefits come from the outputs integration and
implementation by the key audience, who will also determine the relevance and
usability of the disseminated content.
Aim: One of the CrowdHEALTH project's objectives is the transition from patient
health records towards the Holistic Health Records (HHRs) and Social HHR. The
CrowdHEALTH project aims at integrating high volumes of health-related data
collected from various sources to support policy-making decisions.
Methods: The European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) supports the
development of an effective Communication and Collaboration Plan identifying the 
messages, the tools and channels in disseminating the project and its outcomes to
the target audience based on the McGuire approach.
Results: The process for defining the dissemination strategy is a cyclic one as
shown in the following figure involving review of each step periodically The next
step was to define the four dimension dissemination approach based on McGuire
attributes of persuasive communication. The objectives, target groups, key
messages, the tools and channels where defined at this stage.
Conclusion: The CrowdHEALTH project and its outcomes were disseminated with a
variety of tools and channels such as scientific journals, conferences,
exhibitions and social media communication.

Introduction: New technologies, including health information technologies, play
an important role in effectiveness of management and nursing care services.
Aim: This study was aimed to determining the use of health information technology
in patient care management in a case study in Iran.
Methods: This Mixed method study was conducted in 2018 in Kowsar Hospital of
Semnan, Iran. Data gathered by an observational checklist and one questionnaire
included two main parts, one demographic and another assessment of information
technology use in care management of inpatients. The researcher prepared the
questionnaire and its validity was verified. The data were organized and analyzed
in the form of a descriptive analytic report. In the process of data collection, 
10 participants including nurses, head nurses, physicians, radiology experts and 
Information Technology (IT) managers were interviewed and data analyzed using
Directed Content Analysis.
Results: Nurses were satisfied with the computerized system and believed it can
facilitate the affair. From the nurse's viewpoint, the most common use of the
Health Information Technology (HIT) were access (observation) of patients admit
and discharge information (100%), providing medicine and equipment, transfer of
patients (92.3%). The least of them were retrieve of evidence in the care process
(0 %) and judgment and analysis of radiological diagnostic procedures (0%). The
potential of electronic record is not still applicable.
Conclusion: Use of modern information and communication technology in hospitals
facilitates access and transfer of information, and also accelerates patient's
admission and discharge process, relation between hospital units, providing
medical equipment supporting affairs' process and diagnostic procedures. However,
modifying organizational policies, improve the infrastructure and enhancing
nurses' motivation in documenting nursing reports can be effective in increasing 
the impact of information technology in care management processes especially in
electronic record and nurse's clinical judgment and evidence-based care.

China.

Background: The evolution of names, from "medical informatics" to "connected
health", implies that the evolvement of technology in health care has been
shifted from technology-oriented to healthcare-oriented implementation. Connected
healthcare, a healthcare platform of remote monitoring and self-management
through technological measures, is suggested to contribute to the efficiency,
cost-effectiveness, and satisfaction of healthcare recipient enhancement.
However, limited understanding of related connected health (CH) terminology may
constrain its implementation. Whether CH is a buzzword only or a practice that
can contribute to an aging society is controversial. Objective: This study aims
to distinguish CH-related terminology and to identify the trend of CH through
reviewing its definition, initiation, development, and evolvement, in order to
offer management insights and implications. The objective is to understand what
is connected and who is cared about in the connected health model so that better 
applications can be addressed for the benefit of society. Method: This study
reviews the evolution of names, from "medical informatics" in the 1970s to
"connected health" after 2000, as well as relevant literature of CH, including
e-health, telemedicine, telehealth, telecare, and m-health, to discover the trend
of technology-related healthcare innovations. Results: The current status and
issues facing accessibility, quality, and cost were presented. Its future trends 
will be explored through reviewing how changes in healthcare are managed, in
addition to its operation and practice. Pre-conditions and requirements for
implementing CH are identified to select a typical case to study. Findings
suggest that areas with a complete business ecosystem-isolated locations,
advanced information technology, aging in population, integrated health, and
social care system-are prevalent for designing friendly CH environments.
Conclusion: The evidence and tendency of technological convergence create a
demand for innovation and partnering with start-up companies that offer a
competitive advantage in innovation.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic conditions require long periods of care and often involve
repeated interactions with multiple healthcare providers. Faced with increasing
illness burden and costs, healthcare systems are currently working towards
integrated care to streamline these interactions and improve efficiency. To
support this, one promising resource is the information on routine care delivery 
stored in various electronic healthcare databases (EHD). In chronic conditions,
care delivery pathways (CDPs) can be constructed by linking multiple data sources
and extracting time-stamped healthcare utilisation events and other medical data 
related to individual or groups of patients over specific time periods; CDPs may 
provide insights into current practice and ways of improving it. Several methods 
have been proposed in recent years to quantify and visualise CDPs. We present the
protocol for a systematic review aiming to describe the content and development
of CDP methods, to derive common recommendations for CDP construction.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. A literature search will be
performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, IEEE, CINAHL and EMBASE, without date
restrictions, to review published papers reporting data-driven chronic CDPs
quantification and visualisation methods. We will describe them using several
characteristics relevant for EHD use in long-term care, grouped into three
domains: (1) clinical (what clinical information does the method use and how was 
it considered relevant?), (2) data science (what are the method's development and
implementation characteristics?) and (3) behavioural (which behaviours and
interactions does the method aim to promote among users and how?). Data
extraction will be performed via deductive content analysis using previously
defined characteristics and accompanied by an inductive analysis to identify and 
code additional relevant features. Results will be presented in descriptive
format and used to compare current CDPs and generate recommendations for future
CDP development initiatives.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Database searches will be initiated in May 2019. The
review is expected to be completed by February 2020. Ethical approval is not
required for this review. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals 
and conference presentations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential differences in circulating levels of T
regulatory (Treg)/T helper 17 (Th17) cells, related inflammatory cytokines and
specific transcription factors in healthy individuals and patients with psoriasis
conforming to one of three Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes:
blood-heat syndrome (BHS), blood-stasis syndrome (BSS) and blood-dryness syndrome
(BDS).
METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with psoriasis were recruited and assigned to one
of three corresponding TCM syndrome groups: BHS (n = 40), BSS (n = 14) and BDS (n
= 13 patients). The control group comprised 21 healthy individuals. The
circulating levels of Treg/Th17 cells in peripheral blood were assessed using
flow cytometry; the levels of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; and the mRNA 
expression of T cell-specific transcription factors retinoic acid-related orphan 
receptor γt (RORγt) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) by quantitative real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The ratio of Th17 cells and the levels of TNF-α and RORγt were all
significantly higher in the BHS and BSS groups than the control group (P < 0.05),
while the ratio of Treg cells and the levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 mRNA in the BHS
group were significantly lower compared with the control group (P < 0.05). No
significant differences were seen between the BSS group and the control group.
The ratio of Th17 cells and the levels of TNF-α and RORγt in the BDS group were
not significantly different from those of the control group; however, the ratio
of Treg cells and the levels of IL-10 and Foxp3 were all lower than those in the 
healthy controls (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Compared with healthy individuals, the ratio of Th17 cells and the
levels of related cytokines were higher, while the ratio of Treg cells and the
levels of related cytokines were lower, in the peripheral blood of psoriasis/BHS 
patients; corresponding results for the BSS and BDS groups also showed
differences. We propose that patterns of differentiation of immunological cells
in psoriasis patients are reflected in corresponding TCM blood syndromes.

This article shares the comprehensive dataset and five visualized examples of
disease categories in Tibetan medicine, or Sowa Rigpa (Tib. Gso ba rig pa),
translated as the "knowledge field of healing." Sowa Rigpa is a scholarly Asian
traditional medical system rigorously transmitted through canonical texts and
oral teachings originating in Tibet with an extensive pharmacopeia, comprehensive
treatment repertoire, and nuanced etiological explications of its nosology of
diseases. This medical tradition is practiced across a broad region of Asia,
particularly in Tibetan regions of China, Himalayan regions of India (Ladakh,
Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh), Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, Russia, and recently in
Europe and North America. The data herein depicts disease classifications listed 
in the encyclopedic compendium "Oral Instructions Treatise" (Man ngag rgyud) of
the Tibetan medical classic, the Four Medical Treatises (Rgyud bzhi), compiled in
written form during the twelfth century CE. Visualized examples depict
etiological relations among diseases in five of the fifteen major categories of
disease: rLung Illnesses, Béken Illneses, Pediatric Conditions, Eye Conditions
and Tropical Infectious Diseases. Disease names were entered into spreadsheet
format and categorized by etiological hierarchical structure. Data are written in
Unicode Tibetan font to retain fidelity to entries in the classical text, with
parallel columns in standard Wylie transliteration. Subsets of the data are
visually depicted through a graphic platform called Interactive Tree of Life to
demonstrate etiological associations. This dataset is the first publicly
available enumeration of the specific diseases, classifications and etiological
relationships from the Tibetan medical classic. The data are linked to the
article entitled "Tibetan Medical Informatics: An Emerging Field in Sowa Rigpa
Pharmacological & Clinical Research" (Dhondrup et al., 2020).

BACKGROUND: Health is poorer in rural areas and a major challenge is care
coordination for complex chronic conditions. The HITECH and 21st Century Cure
Acts emphasize health information exchange which underpins activities required to
improve care coordination.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Using semi-structured interviews and surveys, we examined 
how providers experience electronic health information exchange during care
coordination since these Acts were implemented, with a focus on rural settings
where health disparities exist. We used a purposive sample that included primary 
care, acute care hospitals, and community health services in the United States.
FINDINGS: We identified seven themes related to care coordination and information
exchange: 'insufficient trust of data'; 'please respond'; 'just fax it'; 'care
plans'; 'needle in the haystack'; 're-documentation'; and 'rural reality'. These 
gaps were magnified when information exchange was required between unaffiliated
electronic health records (EHRs) about shared patients, which was more pronounced
in rural settings.
CONCLUSION: Policy and incentive modifications are likely needed to overcome the 
observed health information technology (HIT) shortcomings. Rural settings in the 
United States accentuate problems that can be addressed through international
medical informatics policy makers and the implementation and evaluation of
interoperable HIT systems.

BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance is based on the continuous and systematic 
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. This informs the development of
early warning systems to monitor epidemics and documents the impact of
intervention measures. The introduction of digital data sources, and specifically
sources available on the internet, has impacted the field of public health
surveillance. New opportunities enabled by the underlying availability and scale 
of internet-based sources (IBSs) have paved the way for novel approaches for
disease surveillance, exploration of health communities, and the study of
epidemic dynamics. This field and approach is also known as infodemiology or
infoveillance.
OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess research findings regarding the
application of IBSs for public health surveillance (infodemiology or
infoveillance). To achieve this, we have presented a comprehensive systematic
literature review with a focus on these sources and their limitations, the
diseases targeted, and commonly applied methods.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted targeting publications
between 2012 and 2018 that leveraged IBSs for public health surveillance,
outbreak forecasting, disease characterization, diagnosis prediction, content
analysis, and health-topic identification. The search results were filtered
according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.
RESULTS: Spanning a total of 162 publications, we determined infectious diseases 
to be the preferred case study (108/162, 66.7%). Of the eight categories of IBSs 
(search queries, social media, news, discussion forums, websites, web
encyclopedia, and online obituaries), search queries and social media were
applied in 95.1% (154/162) of the reviewed publications. We also identified
limitations in representativeness and biased user age groups, as well as high
susceptibility to media events by search queries, social media, and web
encyclopedias.
CONCLUSIONS: IBSs are a valuable proxy to study illnesses affecting the general
population; however, it is important to characterize which diseases are best
suited for the available sources; the literature shows that the level of
engagement among online platforms can be a potential indicator. There is a
necessity to understand the population's online behavior; in addition, the
exploration of health information dissemination and its content is significantly 
unexplored. With this information, we can understand how the population
communicates about illnesses online and, in the process, benefit public health.

BACKGROUND: Monitoring and evaluations of digital health (DH) solutions for the
management of chronic diseases are quite heterogeneous and evidences around
evaluating frameworks are inconsistent. An evidenced-based framework is needed to
inform the evaluation process and rationale of such interventions. We aimed to
explore the nature, extent and components of existing DH frameworks for chronic
diseases.
METHODS: This review was conducted based on the five steps of Arksey and
O'Malley's scoping review methodology. Out of 172 studies identified from,
PubMed, Embase and Web of Science, 11 met our inclusion criteria. The reviewed
studies developed DH frameworks for chronic diseases and published between 2010
and 2018.
RESULTS: According to WHO guidelines for monitoring and evaluation of DH
interventions, we identified seven Conceptual frameworks, two Results frameworks,
one Logical framework and one Theory of change. The frameworks developed for
providing interventions such as self-management, achieving personal goals and
reducing relapse for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and severe mental health. A few studies reported evaluation of 
the frameworks using randomised clinical trials (n=3) and feasibility testing via
Likert scale survey (n=2). A wide range of outcomes were reported including
access to care, cost-effectiveness, behavioural outcomes, patient-provider
communications, technology acceptance and user experience.
CONCLUSION: There is a lack of evidence on the application of consistent DH
frameworks. Future research should address the use of evidence-based frameworks
into the research design, monitoring and evaluation process. This review explores
the nature of DH frameworks for the management of chronic diseases and provides
examples to guide monitoring and evaluation of interventions.

BACKGROUND: Compassion is a vital component to the achievement of positive health
outcomes, particularly in mental health care. The rise of digital technologies
may influence the delivery of compassionate care, and thus this relationship
between compassion and digital health care needs to be better understood.
OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to identify existing digital technologies
being used by patients and health professionals in the delivery of mental health 
care, understand how digital technologies are being used in the delivery of
compassionate mental health care, and determine the facilitators of and barriers 
to digital technology use among patients and health professionals in the delivery
of compassionate mental health care.
METHODS: We conducted this scoping review through a search of Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System Online (MEDLINE), MEDLINE In-Process and EPub Ahead of Print, PsycINFO,
and Web of Science for articles published from 1990 to 2019.
RESULTS: Of the 4472 articles screened, 37 articles were included for data
extraction. Telemedicine was the most widely used technology by mental health
professionals. Digital technologies were described as facilitating compassionate 
care and were classified using a conceptual model to identify each digital
intersection with compassionate care. Facilitators of and barriers to providing
compassionate care through digital technology were identified, including
increased safety for providers, health care professional perceptions and
abilities, and the use of picture-in-picture feedback to evaluate social cues.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing digital technology into mental health care can improve 
the current delivery of compassionate care and create novel ways to provide
compassion. However, as this is a new area of study, mental health professionals 
and organizations alike should be mindful that compassionate human-centered care 
is maintained in the delivery of digital health care. Future research could
develop tools to facilitate and evaluate the enactment of compassion within
digital health care.

BACKGROUND: With the continuous development of the internet and the explosive
growth in data, big data technology has emerged. With its ongoing development and
application, cloud computing technology provides better data storage and
analysis. The development of cloud health care provides a more convenient and
effective solution for health. Studying the evolution of knowledge and research
hotspots in the field of cloud health care is increasingly important for medical 
informatics. Scholars in the medical informatics community need to understand the
extent of the evolution of and possible trends in cloud health care research to
inform their future research.
OBJECTIVE: Drawing on the cloud health care literature, this study aimed to
describe the development and evolution of research themes in cloud health care
through a knowledge map and common word analysis.
METHODS: A total of 2878 articles about cloud health care was retrieved from the 
Web of Science database. We used cybermetrics to analyze and visualize the
keywords in these articles. We created a knowledge map to show the evolution of
cloud health care research. We used co-word analysis to identify the hotspots and
their evolution in cloud health care research.
RESULTS: The evolution and development of cloud health care services are
described. In 2007-2009 (Phase I), most scholars used cloud computing in the
medical field mainly to reduce costs, and grid computing and cloud computing were
the primary technologies. In 2010-2012 (Phase II), the security of cloud systems 
became of interest to scholars. In 2013-2015 (Phase III), medical informatization
enabled big data for health services. In 2016-2017 (Phase IV), machine learning
and mobile technologies were introduced to the medical field.
CONCLUSIONS: Cloud health care research has been rapidly developing worldwide,
and technologies used in cloud health research are simultaneously diverging and
becoming smarter. Cloud-based mobile health, cloud-based smart health, and the
security of cloud health data and systems are three possible trends in the future
development of the cloud health care field.

Objective: Mobile health interventions have surged in popularity but their
implementation varies widely and evidence of effectiveness is mixed. We sought to
advance understanding of the diversity of behavior change techniques in mHealth
interventions, especially those that leverage advanced mobile technologies.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2007 and 
2017 in high-impact journals in medicine, medical informatics, and health
psychology to identify randomized controlled trials in which the effectiveness of
an mobile health intervention was tested. Search terms included a mix of general 
(e.g. mobile health), hardware (e.g. Android, iPhone), and format (e.g. SMS,
application) terms.
Results: In a systematic review of 21 studies, we found the techniques of
personalization, feedback and monitoring, and associations were most commonly
used in mobile health interventions, but there remains considerable opportunity
to leverage more sophisticated aspects of ubiquitous computing. We found that
prompts and cues were the most common behavior change techniques used in
effective trials, but there was notable overlap in behavior change techniques
used in ineffective trials.
Conclusions: Our results identify techniques that are commonly used in mobile
health interventions and highlight pathways to advance the science of mobile
health.

With the emergence of electronic health records, the reuse of clinical data
offers new perspectives for the diagnosis and management of patients with rare
diseases. However, there are many obstacles to the repurposing of clinical data. 
The development of decision support systems depends on the ability to recruit
patients, extract and integrate the patients' data, mine and stratify these data,
and integrate the decision support algorithm into patient care. This last step
requires an adaptability of the electronic health records to integrate learning
health system tools. In this literature review, we examine the research that
provides solutions to unlock these barriers and accelerate translational
research: structured electronic health records and free-text search engines to
find patients, data warehouses and natural language processing to extract
phenotypes, machine learning algorithms to classify patients, and similarity
metrics to diagnose patients. Medical informatics is experiencing an impellent
request to develop decision support systems, and this requires ethical
considerations for clinicians and patients to ensure appropriate use of health
data.

RATIONALE: Aspiration is a common sequela post stroke as a result of
oropharyngeal dysphagia. It is primarily managed using the poorly empirically
supported intervention of thickened liquids. Where evidence is limited,
clinicians may rely on clinical practice guidelines to support decision making.
The purpose of this systematic review and narrative synthesis was to evaluate the
evidentiary bases of recommendations made by stroke clinical practice guidelines 
regarding the thickened liquids intervention.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on stroke clinical guidelines
retrieved via searches conducted across a range of databases including Academic
Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library as well as through
association websites. Guidelines were eligible for inclusion if they focused on
adult stroke populations, made recommendations relating to the thickened liquid
intervention and were published between January 2010 and December 2018. Four
independent reviewers rated methodological quality using the AGREE-II instrument.
Intervention recommendations were extracted and analysed using the Criteria for
Levels of Evidence Reported from the Canadian Stroke Best Practice
Recommendations and a novel framework examining the appropriateness of the
supporting evidence.
RESULTS: Thirteen clinical guidelines were included in the review. Methodological
quality was variable with seven rating as good-excellent overall. Thirty
recommendations regarding the intervention were extracted. Of these, 16
recommendations were classed as a recommendation to use the treatment and all
guidelines made this recommendation. Much of the evidence used to scaffold
recommendations did not directly support the intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limited evidence base for the thickened liquid
intervention, there was consensus among stroke guidelines in recommending it.
This is despite limited empirical support. Furthermore, much of the evidence used
to support recommendations was not appropriate, suggesting less than satisfactory
evidence-based practices in formulating recommendations. In this case, clinical
guidelines may not be reliable decision-support tools for facilitating clinical
decision making.

Author information: 
(1)Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, US National Library
of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.

OBJECTIVE: Reliable longitudinal risk prediction for hospitalized patients is
needed to provide quality care. Our goal is to develop a generalizable model
capable of leveraging clinical notes to predict healthcare-associated diseases
24-96 hours in advance.
METHODS: We developed a reCurrent Additive Network for Temporal RIsk Prediction
(CANTRIP) to predict the risk of hospital acquired (occurring ≥ 48 hours after
admission) acute kidney injury, pressure injury, or anemia ≥ 24 hours before it
is implicated by the patient's chart, labs, or notes. We rely on the MIMIC III
critical care database and extract distinct positive and negative cohorts for
each disease. We retrospectively determine the date-of-event using structured and
unstructured criteria and use it as a form of indirect supervision to train and
evaluate CANTRIP to predict disease risk using clinical notes.
RESULTS: Our experiments indicate that CANTRIP, operating on text alone, obtains 
74%-87% area under the curve and 77%-85% Specificity. Baseline shallow models
showed lower performance on all metrics, while bidirectional long short-term
memory obtained the highest Sensitivity at the cost of significantly lower
Specificity and Precision.
DISCUSSION: Proper model architecture allows clinical text to be successfully
harnessed to predict nosocomial disease, outperforming shallow models and
obtaining similar performance to disease-specific models reported in the
literature.
CONCLUSION: Clinical text on its own can provide a competitive alternative to
traditional structured features (eg, lab values, vital signs). CANTRIP is able to
generalize across nosocomial diseases without disease-specific feature extraction
and is available at https://github.com/h4ste/cantrip.

BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation is one of the advanced treatment options
performed even in patients suffering from end-stage lung disease. Due to the
positive results of medical informatics in other fields of medicine, lung
transplant researchers have also conducted remarkable studies to improve
transplant outcomes. The main objective of this article was to review the current
studies of health information technology used in lung transplantation.
METHODS: A systematic search was performed in four scientific databases (Web of
Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed) from January 2000 to December 2018. 
The criteria for inclusion were included in any study describing the use of
health information technology or medical informatics in terms of lung
transplantation, English papers, and original researchers. The retrieved articles
were accordingly screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria to select
relevant studies. The survey and synthesis of included articles were conducted
based on predefined classification.
RESULTS: Out of 263 articles, 27 studies met our inclusion criteria. All included
studies involved the application of health information technology in lung
transplantation. The types of health information technology methods applied in
reviewed articles included mhealth (11.1 %), DSS (7.4 %), decision aid tools (7.4
%), telemedicine (22.2 %), AI methods (11.1 %), data mining (37 %), and patient
education (3.7 %). The majority of studies (88.9 %) showed the positive impact of
health information technology to enhance lung transplantation outcomes. Finally, 
the main approaches in different phases of lung transplantation processes were
interpreted and summarized in the visual model.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides new insights regarding the
application of medical informatics in the lung transplantation domain. The
missing areas of medical informatics in the lung transplantation domain were
recognized through this study.

Author information: 
(1)Health Information Management Research Center, Kashan University of Medical
Sciences, Kashan, Iran.

Introduction: Information technology (IT) is an important component of medical
informatics. Information needs to be accepted by users to function effectively.
At different ages and from different views, several models have been proposed and
used to show factors affecting users' IT acceptance. However, such models are in 
need of frequent revision and development due to variable conditions.
Aim: The present research aims to design a new health IT acceptance model from
Iranian users' views. The research aims both to design a model for status quo by 
reviewing previous models and consider features of Iranian users.
Methods: This is a correlative, cross-sectional study. Firstly, the primary model
was presented by studying important IT acceptance models. Then, a structured
questionnaire was designed and, after confirmation of validity and reliability of
the questionnaire, it was given to users of information and health IT systems in 
different wards of hospitals in Iran. Data were analyzed by SPSS and Lisrel and
the final model was designed by structural equations.
Results: The model showed that there are six key factors which are effective on
attitude and use intention including performance expectancy, observability,
effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, empowerment and subjective norms via 
three interface factors of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
self-efficacy. The size of technology use is an important factor in technology
acceptance and application as well.
Conclusion: The present model has more details compared to the other models and
can show a new image of important factors in technology acceptance and their
relationships.

Milano, Milan, Italy.

BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single
infectious agent, with around 1.5 million deaths reported in 2018, and is a major
contributor to suffering worldwide, with an estimated 10 million new cases every 
year. In the context of the World Health Organization's End TB strategy and the
quest for digital innovations, there is a need to understand what is happening
around the world regarding research into the use of digital technology for better
TB care and control.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the state of
research on the use of digital technology to enhance TB care and control. This
study provides an overview of publications covering this subject and answers 3
main questions: (1) to what extent has the issue been addressed in the scientific
literature between January 2016 and March 2019, (2) which countries have been
investing in research in this field, and (3) what digital technologies were used?
METHODS: A Web-based search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science. Studies
that describe the use of digital technology with specific reference to keywords
such as TB, digital health, eHealth, and mHealth were included. Data from
selected studies were synthesized into 4 functions using narrative and graphical 
methods. Such digital health interventions were categorized based on 2
classifications, one by function and the other by targeted user.
RESULTS: A total of 145 relevant studies were identified out of the 1005
published between January 2016 and March 2019. Overall, 72.4% (105/145) of the
research focused on patient care and 20.7% (30/145) on surveillance and
monitoring. Other programmatic functions 4.8% (7/145) and electronic learning
2.1% (3/145) were less frequently studied. Most digital health technologies used 
for patient care included primarily diagnostic 59.4% (63/106) and treatment
adherence tools 40.6% (43/106). On the basis of the second type of
classification, 107 studies targeted health care providers (107/145, 73.8%), 20
studies targeted clients (20/145, 13.8%), 17 dealt with data services (17/145,
11.7%), and 1 study was on the health system or resource management. The first
authors' affiliations were mainly from 3 countries: the United States (30/145
studies, 20.7%), China (20/145 studies, 13.8%), and India (17/145 studies,
11.7%). The researchers from the United States conducted their research both
domestically and abroad, whereas researchers from China and India conducted all
studies domestically.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of research conducted between January 2016 and March
2019 on digital interventions for TB focused on diagnostic tools and treatment
adherence technologies, such as video-observed therapy and SMS. Only a few
studies addressed interventions for data services and health system or resource
management.

INTRODUCTION: Non-adherence to antipsychotic medications for individuals with
serious mental illness increases risk of relapse and hospitalisation. Real time
monitoring of adherence would allow for early intervention. AI2 is a both a
personal nudging system and a clinical decision support tool that applies machine
learning on Medicare prescription and benefits data to raise alerts when patients
have discontinued antipsychotic medications without supervision, or when
essential routine health checks have not been performed.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We outline two intervention models using AI2. In the first 
use-case, the personal nudging system, patients receive text messages when an
alert of a missed medication or routine health check is detected by AI2. In the
second use-case, as a clinical decision support tool, AI2 generated alerts are
presented as flags through a dashboard to the community mental health
professionals. Implementation protocols for different scenarios of AI2, along
with a mixed-methods evaluation, are planned to identify pragmatic issues
necessary to inform a larger randomised control trial, as well as improve the
application.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by The Southern
Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee. The dissemination of this
trial will serve to inform further implementation of the AI2 into daily personal 
and clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: To achieve universal access to medical resources, China introduced
its second health care reform in 2010, with health information technologies (HIT)
as an important technical support point.
OBJECTIVE: This study is the first attempt to explore the unique contributions
and characteristics of HIT development in Chinese hospitals from the three major 
aspects of hospital HIT-human resources, funding, and materials-in an all-around,
multi-angled, and time-longitudinal manner, so as to serve as a reference for
decision makers in China and the rest of the world when formulating HIT
development strategies.
METHODS: A longitudinal research method is used to analyze the results of the
CHIMA Annual Survey of Hospital Information System in China carried out by a
Chinese national industrial association, CHIMA, from 2007 to 2018. The
development characteristics of human resources, funding, and materials of HIT in 
China for the past 12 years are summarized. The Bass model is used to fit and
predict the popularization trend of EMR in Chinese hospitals from 2007 to 2020.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2018, the CHIMA Annual Survey interviewed 10,954 hospital
CIOs across 32 administrative regions in Mainland China. Compared with 2007, as
of 2018, in terms of human resources, the average full time equivalent (FTE)
count in each hospital's IT center is still lower than the average level of US
counterparts in 2014 (9.66 FTEs vs. 34 FTEs). The proportion of CIOs with a
master's degree or above was 25.61%, showing an increase of 18.51%, among which
those with computer-related backgrounds accounted for 64.75%, however, those with
a medical informatics background only accounted for 3.67%. In terms of funding,
the sampled hospitals' annual HIT investment increased from ¥957,700 (US
$136,874) to ¥6.376 million (US $911,261), and the average investment per bed
increased from ¥4,600 (US $658) to ¥8,100 (US $1158). In terms of information
system construction, as of 2018, the average EMR implementation rate of the
sampled hospitals exceeded the average level of their US counterparts in 2015 and
their German counterparts in 2017 (85.26% vs. 83.8% vs. 68.4%, respectively). The
results of the Bass prediction model show that Chinese hospitals will likely
reach an adoption rate of 91.4% by 2020 (R2=0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: In more than 10 years, based on this top-down approach, China's
medical care industry has accepted government instructions and implemented the
unified model planned by administrative intervention. With only about one-fifth
of the required funding, and about one-fourth of the required human resources per
hospital as compared to the US HITECH project, China's EMR coverage in 2018
exceeded the average level of its US counterparts in 2015 and German counterparts
in 2017. This experience deserves further study and analysis by other countries.

BACKGROUND: Health information technologies (HITs) hold enormous promise for
improving access to and providing better quality of mental health care. However, 
despite the spread of such technologies in high-income countries, these
technologies have not yet been commonly adopted in low- and middle-income
countries. People living in these parts of the world are at risk of experiencing 
physical, technological, and social health inequalities. A possible solution is
to utilize the currently available HITs developed in other counties.
OBJECTIVE: Using participatory design methodologies with Colombian end users
(young people, their supportive others, and health professionals), this study
aimed to conduct co-design workshops to culturally adapt a Web-based Mental
Health eClinic (MHeC) for young people, perform one-on-one user-testing sessions 
to evaluate an alpha prototype of a Spanish version of the MHeC and adapt it to
the Colombian context, and inform the development of a skeletal framework and
alpha prototype for a Colombian version of the MHeC (MHeC-C).
METHODS: This study involved the utilization of a research and development (R&D) 
cycle including 4 iterative phases: co-design workshops; knowledge translation;
tailoring to language, culture, and place (or context); and one-on-one
user-testing sessions.
RESULTS: A total of 2 co-design workshops were held with 18 users-young people
(n=7) and health professionals (n=11). Moreover, 10 users participated in
one-on-one user-testing sessions-young people (n=5), supportive others (n=2), and
health professionals (n=3). A total of 204 source documents were collected and
605 annotations were coded. A thematic analysis resulted in 6 themes (ie,
opinions about the MHeC-C, Colombian context, functionality, content, user
interface, and technology platforms). Participants liked the idea of having an
MHeC designed and adapted for Colombian young people, and its 5 key elements were
acceptable in this context (home page and triage system, self-report assessment, 
dashboard of results, booking and video-visit system, and personalized well-being
plan). However, to be relevant in Colombia, participants stressed the need to
develop additional functionality (eg, phone network backup; chat; geolocation;
and integration with electronic medical records, apps, or electronic tools) as
well as an adaptation of the self-report assessment. Importantly, the latter not 
only included language but also culture and context.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of an R&D cycle that also included processes for
adaptation to Colombia (language, culture, and context) resulted in the
development of an evidence-based, language-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and
context-adapted HIT that is relevant, applicable, engaging, and usable in both
the short and long term. The resultant R&D cycle allowed for the adaptation of an
already available HIT (ie, MHeC) to the MHeC-C-a low-cost and scalable technology
solution for low- and middle-income countries like Colombia, which has the
potential to provide young people with accessible, available, affordable, and
integrated mental health care at the right time.

Objectives: To analyze current practices in shared decision-making (SDM) in
primary care and perform a needs assessment for the role of information
technology (IT) interventions.
Materials and Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted in three phases: (1)
ethnographic observation of clinical encounters, (2) patient interviews, and (3) 
physician interviews. SDM was measured using the validated OPTION scale.
Semistructured interviews followed an interview guide (developed by our
multidisciplinary team) informed by the Traditional Decision Conflict Scale and
Shared Decision Making Questionnaire. Field notes were independently coded and
analyzed by two reviewers in Dedoose.
Results: Twenty-four patient encounters were observed in 3 diverse practices with
an average OPTION score of 57.2 (0-100 scale; 95% confidence interval [CI],
51.8-62.6). Twenty-two patient and 8 physician interviews were conducted until
thematic saturation was achieved. Cohen's kappa, measuring coder agreement, was
0.42. Patient domains were: establishing trust, influence of others, flexibility,
frustrations, values, and preferences. Physician domains included frustrations,
technology (concerns, existing use, and desires), and decision making (current
methods used, challenges, and patients' understanding).
Discussion: Given low SDM observed, multiple opportunities for technology to
enhance SDM exist based on specific OPTION items that received lower scores,
including: (1) checking the patient's preferred information format, (2) asking
the patient's preferred level of involvement in decision making, and (3)
providing an opportunity for deferring a decision. Based on data from interviews,
patients and physicians value information exchange and are open to technologies
that enhance communication of care options.
Conclusion: Future primary care IT platforms should prioritize the 3 quantitative
gaps identified to improve physician-patient communication and relationships.
Additionally, SDM tools should seek to standardize common workflow steps across
decisions and focus on barriers to increasing adoption of effective SDM tools
into routine primary care.

Despite the demonstrated value of patient-centered care, health systems have been
slow to integrate the patient's voice into care delivery through patient-reported
outcomes (PROs) with electronic tools. This is due in part to the complex
interplay of technology, workflow, and human factors that shape the success of
electronic PROs (ePROs) use. The 2018 American Medical Informatics Association
Annual Symposium served as the setting for a half-day interactive workshop with
diverse stakeholders to discuss proposed best practices for the planning, design,
deployment, and evaluation of ePROs. We provide this collective commentary that
synthesizes participant feedback regarding critical challenges that prohibit the 
scale and spread of ePROs across healthcare delivery systems, including
governance and leadership, workflow and human factors, informatics, and data
science. In order to realize the promise of ePROs at scale, adaptable approaches 
are critical to balance the needs of individual users with health systems at
large.

BACKGROUND: More than a million health and well-being apps are available from the
Apple and Google app stores. Some apps use built-in mobile phone sensors to
generate health data. Clinicians and patients can find information regarding safe
and effective mobile health (mHealth) apps in third party-curated mHealth app
libraries.
OBJECTIVE: These independent Web-based repositories guide app selection from
trusted lists, but do they offer apps using ubiquitous, low-cost smartphone
sensors to improve health? This study aimed to identify the types of built-in
mobile phone sensors used in apps listed on curated health app libraries, the
range of health conditions these apps address, and the cross-platform
availability of the apps.
METHODS: This systematic survey reviewed three such repositories (National Health
Service Apps Library, AppScript, and MyHealthApps), assessing the availability of
apps using built-in mobile phone sensors for the diagnosis or treatment of health
conditions.
RESULTS: A total of 18 such apps were identified and included in this survey,
representing 1.1% (8/699) to 3% (2/76) of all apps offered by the respective
libraries examined. About one-third (7/18, 39%) of the identified apps offered
cross-platform Apple and Android versions, with a further 50% (9/18) only
dedicated to Apple and 11% (2/18) to Android. About one-fourth (4/18, 22%) of the
identified apps offered dedicated diagnostic functions, with a majority featuring
therapeutic (9/18, 50%) or combined functionality (5/18, 28%). Cameras, touch
screens, and microphones were the most frequently used built-in sensors. Health
concerns addressed by these apps included respiratory, dermatological,
neurological, and anxiety conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Diligent mHealth app library curation, medical device regulation
constraints, and cross-platform differences in mobile phone sensor architectures 
may all contribute to the observed limited availability of mHealth apps using
built-in phone sensors in curated mHealth app libraries. However, more efforts
are needed to increase the number of such apps on curated lists, as they offer
easily accessible low-cost options to assist people in managing clinical
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Wearables provide opportunities for frequent health data collection
and symptom monitoring. The feasibility of using consumer cellular smartwatches
to provide information both on symptoms and contemporary sensor data has not yet 
been investigated.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of
using cellular smartwatches to capture multiple patient-reported outcomes per day
alongside continuous physical activity data over a 3-month period in people
living with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
METHODS: For the KOALAP (Knee OsteoArthritis: Linking Activity and Pain) study, a
novel cellular smartwatch app for health data collection was developed.
Participants (age ≥50 years; self-diagnosed knee OA) received a smartwatch
(Huawei Watch 2) with the KOALAP app. When worn, the watch collected sensor data 
and prompted participants to self-report outcomes multiple times per day.
Participants were invited for a baseline and follow-up interview to discuss their
motivations and experiences. Engagement with the watch was measured using daily
watch wear time and the percentage completion of watch questions. Interview
transcripts were analyzed using grounded thematic analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 26 people participated in the study. Good use and engagement 
were observed over 3 months: most participants wore the watch on 75% (68/90) of
days or more, for a median of 11 hours. The number of active participants
declined over the study duration, especially in the final week. Among
participants who remained active, neither watch time nor question completion
percentage declined over time. Participants were mainly motivated to learn about 
their symptoms and enjoyed the self-tracking aspects of the watch. Barriers to
full engagement were battery life limitations, technical problems, and
unfulfilled expectations of the watch. Participants reported that they would have
liked to report symptoms more than 4 or 5 times per day.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that capture of patient-reported outcomes multiple 
times per day with linked sensor data from a smartwatch is feasible over at least
a 3-month period.

The treatment of comorbid patients is a hot problem in Medical Informatics, since
the plain application of multiple Computer-Interpretable Guidelines (CIGs) can
lead to interactions that are potentially dangerous for the patients. The
specialized literature has mostly focused on the "a priori" or "execution-time"
analysis of the interactions between multiple Computer-Interpretable Guidelines
(CIGs), and/or CIG "merge". In this paper, we face a complementary problem,
namely, the a posteriori analysis of the treatment of comorbid patients. Given
the CIGs, the history of the status of the patient, and the log of the clinical
actions executed on her, we try to explain the actions executed on the patient
(i.e., the log) in terms of the actions recommended by the CIGs, of their
potential interactions, and of the possible ways of managing each such
interaction, pointing out (i) deviations from CIG recommendations not explained
in terms of interaction management (if any) and (ii) unmanaged interactions (if
any). Our approach is based on Answer Set Programming, and, to face realistic
problems, devotes specific attention to the temporal dimension.

Background: Evidence indicates that applying technology to medication safety will
improve the quality of medical services and enhance the medication-error
management climate. The perceived benefits of using the medication safety system 
are an important factor for adopting a system.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of the
perceived benefits of using a medication safety system in the relationship
between transformational leadership and the medication-error management climate.
Methods: A total of 153 staff nurses from 11 secondary or tertiary hospitals in
Korea were included. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, analysis of variance,
Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses were used.
Results: Transformational leadership was significantly correlated with the
perceived benefits of the system use (r = .17, p = .032) and medication-error
management climate (r = .55, p < .001). The perceived benefit of using the
medication safety system was a mediator between transformational leadership and
the medication-error management climate.
Conclusions: When chief executive officers construct and implement a medication
safety system in their hospitals, transformational leadership can enhance the
perceived benefits of system use, which is an important factor that contributes
to a positive medication-error management climate.

INTRODUCTION: Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) systems can improve the
quality of prescribing decisions and substantially reduce the risk of serious
medication errors in hospitals. However, realising these benefits depends on
ensuring that relevant sociotechnical considerations are addressed. Optimising
ePrescribing systems is essential to maximise the associated benefits and
minimise the accompanying risks of these large-scale and expensive health
informatics infrastructures.
METHODS: We will undertake a systematic scoping review of the literature to
identify strategies to achieve optimisation of ePrescribing systems. We will
search Medline, Embase and CINAHL for the period 1 January 2010 to 1 June 2019
and the grey literature by using Google Scholar. Independent reviewers will
screen the results using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and will
extract data for narrative and thematic synthesis.
DISCUSSION: This work will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and we will
ensure that the findings are both accessible and interpretable to the public,
academics, policymakers and National Health Service leaders.

After over half a century of computer application development in medicine, the US
health system has gone digital with an enthusiastic confidence for rapid
improvements in care outcomes, especially those of quality of care, safety, and
productivity. The bad news is that evidence for the justification of the hype
around health information technology (HIT) is conflicting, and the expected
benefits of a digital health system have not yet materialized. We propose a
national system for monitoring HIT impact based on the paradigm of the learning
health system (LHS): learning from practical experience through high-quality,
ongoing monitoring of care outcomes. Our proposal aims at leveraging current de
facto standard research data repositories used to support large-scale clinical
studies by incorporating data needed for more robust HIT assessments and
application of rigorous research designs that are now feasible on a large scale.

Objectives: Identifying new relations between medical entities, such as drugs,
diseases, and side effects, is typically a resource-intensive task, involving
experimentation and clinical trials. The increased availability of related data
and curated knowledge enables a computational approach to this task, notably by
training models to predict likely relations. Such models rely on meaningful
representations of the medical entities being studied. We propose a generic
features vector representation that leverages co-occurrences of medical terms,
linked with PubMed citations.
Materials and Methods: We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
representation by inferring two types of relations: a drug causes a side effect
and a drug treats an indication. To predict these relations and assess their
effectiveness, we applied 2 modeling approaches: multi-task modeling using neural
networks and single-task modeling based on gradient boosting machines and
logistic regression.
Results: These trained models, which predict either side effects or indications, 
obtained significantly better results than baseline models that use a single
direct co-occurrence feature. The results demonstrate the advantage of a
comprehensive representation.
Discussion: Selecting the appropriate representation has an immense impact on the
predictive performance of machine learning models. Our proposed representation is
powerful, as it spans multiple medical domains and can be used to predict a wide 
range of relation types.
Conclusion: The discovery of new relations between various medical entities can
be translated into meaningful insights, for example, related to drug development 
or disease understanding. Our representation of medical entities can be used to
train models that predict such relations, thus accelerating healthcare-related
discoveries.

Disease progression often differs among patients. According to study findings,
changes in vital signs, blood oxygen saturation, and consciousness are each
related closely to acute deterioration in disease status (Sutherasan et al.,
2018). The early warning system (EWS) is a predictive approach to detecting
deterioration in disease condition based on the observation of slight variations 
in patient vital signs and clinical symptoms (Smith et al., 2014). Most patients 
experience changes in specific physiological variables before experiencing a
cardiac arrest. The implementation of a comprehensive EWS facilitates the early
identification and prevention of serious adverse events such as unexpected
cardiac arrest and death, and may help reduce the risk of other unexpected events
as well (Gerry et al., 2017). For medical team members, the use of EWS not only
permits the detection of changes in patient condition at an early stage but also 
allows healthcare workers to respond more proactively and effectively. Moreover, 
EWS has been shown to improve communication, increase cooperation, and strengthen
personal responsibility among healthcare workers (Burns et al., 2018). In
summary, implementing EWS allows the prompt initiation of appropriate patient
treatment and helps improve patient-care outcomes. While recognizing the
importance of incorporating EWS into patient care in clinical and home-based
institutions as an important strategy to protecting the lives of patients,
appropriate standardized warning systems must be tailored to address different
disease characteristics. Changes in patient condition are traditionally addressed
through nursing assessment followed by physician notification and response.
However, this process may be affected by factors such as assessment accuracy,
cultural differences, confidence, and past experiences that may result in
decision-making errors (Wood, Chaboyer, & Carr, 2019). The integration of EWS and
medical informatics technology is expected to reduce the risks of
human-interpretation-related omissions and errors (Downey, Tahir, Randell, Brown,
& Jayne, 2017). Although the use of medical informatics technology to enhance EWS
remains in its infancy, this will certainly be one of the future trends in
patient care. The articles in this issue, in addition to introducing EWS,
elucidate the current application of EWS in clinical critical conditions and
introduce how informatics technology is being combined in home EWS applications. 
These articles comprise a rich body of information on EWS that may referenced in 
clinical nursing care, home care, education, and research.

守護病人生命的早期警示系統.疾病的進展往往因個體的差異性而有所不同，根據研究發現生命徵象、血氧飽和度和意識狀態呈現出的變化，與疾病的急性惡化有著密不可分的相關性（
Sutherasan et al., 2018），而早期警示系統（early warning system,
EWS）就是透過病人的生命徵象及臨床症狀之些微變化，來偵測病情可能出現惡化的一種預測方式（Smith et al.,
2014）。絕大多數的病人在心跳停止前會出現生理徵兆的變化，而運用一個完善的EWS可早期識別出病人可能出現非預期的心跳停止或死亡等嚴重不良事件（serious
adverse events），進而減少病人面臨非預期風險（Gerry et al.,
2017）。另一方面，對於醫護團隊人員而言，EWS的運用不僅能早期發現病人的病情變化，讓相關人員做出積極的反應，並且能改善醫護團隊間的溝通、提升團隊間的合作及增強
健康照護者的個人責任感（Burns et al.,
2018）。總而言之，使用EWS可及時給予病人適當的治療，這對病人的照護結果來說是一個正面的影響，不論是在臨床或居家機構，將EWS融入病人照顧的處置中，是守護病人
生命極為重要的策略，但仍需依不同疾病特性來設計適當的標準化警示系統。在病人發生病情變化時，傳統上的做法是先由護理人員評估其病情，再由護理人員決定是否通知醫師處理，
但這個過程中有可能受到評估的正確性、文化差異性、自信心和過去經驗的影響而產生人為錯誤（Wood, Chaboyer, & Carr,
2019），而警示系統與資訊科技結合的進階發展，將可減少人為判讀出現之遺漏與錯誤（Downey, Tahir, Randell, Brown, & Jayne, 
2017），雖然使用醫學資訊技術增強預警系統仍處於起步階段，但這必將是未來病人照護上的趨勢之一。在本期專欄中，除了簡介EWS的運用之外，也說明目前EWS在臨床重症
狀況下的應用，以及結合資訊科技於居家EWS中的介紹，這些專欄文章充分討論了EWS，可提供臨床護理、居家照護、教學以及研究上之參考。.

The International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is used to group and
report health conditions and factors, provides a basis for healthcare statistics.
The 11th revision of the ICD (ICD-11) released by the World Health Organization
provides stakeholders with novel perspectives on solving the complexity of
critical problems in medical informatics. This study conducts a bibliometric
analysis of research published over the period of 1989-2018 to examine the
development of ICD-related research and its trends. First, over 4000 ICD-related 
papers spanning the 30-year period are retrieved from the Web of Science
database. Then, based on the meta data of the selected papers, time trend
analysis is performed to examine the development of different ICD revisions.
Finally, the keywords and topics of these papers are analyzed and visualized
using VOSViewer and CiteSpace. Our findings indicate that ICD-11-related research
has grown rapidly in recent years compared with studies on ICD-9 and ICD-10.
Moreover, the most popular research directions of ICD-11 include the topics
psychiatry, psychology, information science, library science, and behavioral
science. In terms of perspectives, information system-related research is more
common than big data- and knowledge discovery-related work. However, the
popularity of big data- and knowledge discovery-related developments has grown in
recent years. The use of ICD-11 facilitates the development of medical
informatics from the perspectives of information systems, big data, and knowledge
discovery.

Deep Learning for Automating the Organization of Institutional Dermatology Image 
Stores.

Wang MZ, Comfere NI, Murphree DH.

A common challenge faced by researchers associated with healthcare institutions
is that data of interest are often contained in electronic medical informatics
systems that are centered on optimizing clinician/clinician and patient/clinician
communication. While this focus naturally enhances the primary goal of care
delivery, it is often suboptimal for secondary research purposes. For example at 
our institution while it is easy for a clinician to view images associated with a
specific patient visit, it remains a challenge for an investigator to assemble a 
cohort of specific images in order to further research objectives. In order to
address this important optimization gap we have developed a system for automated 
image categorization based on a deep neural network. This image classifier
organizes the contents of an electronic health record system in a manner which is
more amenable to further research by specifically dividing all available images
into a lexicon of subclasses. While the current study is focused on
dermatology-related images collected by a combined primary and tertiary care
center, we expect similar approaches to aid a variety of institutions and
clinical specialties.

OBJECTIVE: In a future full-scale randomised controlled trial, we plan to compare
satisfaction with a standard website versus satisfaction with a participatory
driven web-application. The participatory driven web-application may facilitate
the delivery of targeted evidence-based advice and information to patients with
low back pain in general practice (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03088774).
This feasibility study is intended to inform a future randomised controlled
trial. The aim is to report on the lessons learned from recruitment to report on 
reasons for loss to follow-up.
RESULTS: We recruited 12 women and 8 men from two general practices with each
practice recruiting for 3 months. Full follow-up data was available in only three
patients (15%). Based on the high loss to follow-up, we do not consider it
feasible to conduct the full-scale confirmatory trial as planned. Modifying
inclusion criteria to include only patients expressing an interest in using
online health information or randomising patients directly at the general
practice, supporting them in accessing the web-application, and letting patients 
respond with their immediate satisfaction may improve the speed of recruitment
and follow-up rates. Furthermore, the participatory driven web-application can be
included in a larger multi-faceted intervention, making the combined intervention
seem more relevant to study participants.

Background: Mandatory relicense of all physicians in Jordan went into effect at
the beginning of May 2018. The bylaw states that all physicians should engage in 
Continuing Professional Development (CPD) in order to upgrade their knowledge and
maintain competency as a prerequisite to renew their license every 5 years. The
characteristics of effective CPD are different from one country to another.
Jordan has decided to link CPD to mandatory relicense; however, no research has
been done to identify the factors that influence CPD offerings, needs, practices,
experiences, and effectiveness in the healthcare sector in Jordan. This paper
reviews the history of CPD and CME, and the different options to upgrade and
improve the competence of physicians. It explores the current practices,
motivation, and barriers for physicians to get engaged in CPD activities in
Jordan.
Purpose: The purpose of this research was to provide a better understanding of
the state of CPD in the healthcare sector in Jordan with a view to informing the 
development of Jordan's first CPD framework. The findings of this research will
provide policymakers with baseline information concerning current CPD practices, 
experiences, and attitudes of physicians towards CPD, and enablers and
contributors to effective CPD in Jordan.
Methods: Stratified clustered self-selected participants that represented
physicians working at all healthcare sectors in Jordan were used in this study. A
structured pre-tested self-reported questionnaire was used to collect the data. A
total of 457 physicians were included in the sample according to one-proportion
sample size calculation method, and they were distributed among the healthcare
sectors based on their shared proportions.
Conclusion: Despite considerable evidence supporting the role of CPD in
maintaining competency of physicians, participating in CPD activities in Jordan
is compromised by lack of mandatory laws and barriers related to staff shortage, 
heavy workload, limited funds, lack of time, and cost. Personal interests and
career progression are the top motivators for CPD. Most Jordanian physicians are 
interested in CPD activities related to health/medical informatics and enhancing 
their skills in evidence-informed practice. We recommend that future
interventions and health policy directions should be informed by these findings
in order to optimize uptake of CPD programs in Jordan.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore whether specific ethical questions
arise with the use of a shared electronic health record (EHR) system, based on
the daily experience of primary care physicians (PCPs).
METHODS: In this qualitative research project, we conducted 14 in-depth
semistructured interviews with PCPs in a tertiary hospital setting.
RESULTS: We identified 4 themes: 1) PCPs describe the EHR as a medicine with side
effects, for which they provide suggestions for improvements; 2) A shared record 
raises ethical questions related to autonomy and trust; 3) Although use of the
EHR often disturbs rapport with the patient, it can also support the
patient-doctor interaction when it becomes an active part of the conversation; 4)
A shared EHR may cause health care providers (and their relatives) to avoid
seeking help for sensitive issues.
DISCUSSION: PCPs fear access to results could cause confusion and anxiety in
patients, resulting in tensions between autonomy and beneficence. Improved
efficiency and quality of care with a shared EHR relies on doctors trusting each 
other's input to avoid duplicate tests. However, this might compromise a
fundamental skeptical attitude in practicing medicine, and we should be aware of 
a risk of increased confirmation and anchoring bias.
CONCLUSION: The EHR is considered to be a work in progress-EHR design could be
improved by examining physicians' coping strategies and implementing their
suggestions for improvement. Ethical questions related to autonomy, trust, and
the status of records that belong to doctor-patients need to be considered in
future research and EHR development.

Peyronie's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the formation of
plaque in the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa, resulting in penis
deformity. It is often associated with penile pain, especially in younger
patients, but it is not rare for pain to be absent; the disease is also
associated with erectile dysfunction and a depressive state in a large percentage
of cases.OBJECTIVE: Aim of our study was to explore the basic knowledge base and 
diagnostic and therapeutic practice patterns in Peyronie's disease (PD) of a
large number of physicians belonging to the Italian Andrology Society (SIA).
METHODS: Our survey is based on two questionnaires which were e-mailed to the
members of the SIA. The first questionnaire explored diagnostic and therapeutic
practice patterns of SIA physicians, while the second questionnaire focused on
their knowledge of the disease, as well as their training and level of experience
in the specific field. We then planned to compare our outcomes with similar PD
surveys from other countries.
RESULTS: The first questionnaire was answered by 142 SIA physicians. The second
questionnaire was answered by 83 SIA physicians. Most respondents (74.6%) chose
penile ultrasonography as first-line diagnostic approach and 47.1% prefer to
perform a color Doppler ultrasound after pharmaco-induced erection. Concerning
the therapeutic practice patterns in active stage of the disease, most
respondents (99.29%) prefer conservative medical therapy. Additionally, most
respondents (64.78%), when failure of conservative treatment had been
established, considered surgical treatment necessary, specifically corporoplasty,
which may be associated with other techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our survey show that, in comparison to their foreign 
counterparts, Italian SIA uro-andrologists have a more proactive diagnostic
approach right from when patients first present. When PD is still in its active
stage, SIA uro-andrologists mostly opt for medical therapy. In advanced disease
or if conservative treatment fails, our survey indicates a greater preference for
surgical treatment. Answers to the theoretical knowledge questions showed that
SIA physicians have a good understanding of the disease's etiology, epidemiology,
and clinical picture, and of the appropriate indications for treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Overconsumption of processed foods has led to an increase in chronic
diet-related diseases such obesity and type 2 diabetes. Although diets high in
fresh fruits and vegetables are linked with healthier outcomes, the specific
mechanisms for these relationships are poorly understood. Experiments examining
plant phytochemical production and breeding programs, or separately on the health
effects of nutritional supplements have yielded results that are sparse, siloed, 
and difficult to integrate between the domains of human health and agriculture.
To connect plant products to health outcomes through their molecular mechanism an
integrated computational resource is necessary.
RESULTS: We created the Aliment to Bodily Condition Knowledgebase (ABCkb) to
connect plants to human health by creating a stepwise path from plant [Formula:
see text] plant product [Formula: see text] human gene [Formula: see text]
pathways [Formula: see text] indication. ABCkb integrates 11 curated sources as
well as relationships mined from Medline abstracts by loading into a graph
database which is deployed via a Docker container. This new resource, provided in
a queryable container with a user-friendly interface connects plant products with
human health outcomes for generating nutritive hypotheses. All scripts used are
available on github ( https://github.com/atrautm1/ABCkb ) along with basic
directions for building the knowledgebase and a browsable interface is available 
( https://abckb.charlotte.edu ).

BACKGROUND: Mobile-phone reminders have gained traction among policymakers as a
way to improve childhood vaccination coverage and timeliness. However, there is
limited evidence on the acceptability of mobile-phone reminders among patients
and caregivers. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the
ownership of mobile-phone device and the willingness to receive mobile-phone
reminders among mothers/caregivers utilizing routine childhood immunization
services in Nigeria.
METHOD: MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, CNKI, AJOL (African Journal Online), and Web of 
Science were systematically searched for studies on the acceptability of
mobile-phone reminders for routine immunization appointments among
mothers/caregivers in Nigeria. Studies were assessed for methodological quality
using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and JBI critical appraisal checklists.
Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects model to generate pooled
estimates (proportion) of mothers who owned at least one mobile phone and
proportion of mothers willing to receive mobile-phone reminders.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies (13 cross-sectional and three interventional) involving 
a total of 9923 mothers across 15 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja 
met inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates showed that the proportion of mothers
who owned at least one mobile phone was 96.4% (95% CI = 94.1-98.2%; I2 = 96.3%)
while the proportion of mothers willing to receive mobile-phone reminders was
86.0% (95% CI = 79.8-91.3%, I2 = 98.4%). Most mothers preferred to receive text
message reminders at least 24 h before the routine immunization appointment day, 
and in the morning hours. Approximately 52.8% of the mothers preferred to receive
reminders in English, the country's official language.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests a high acceptability for mobile-phone
reminder interventions to improve routine childhood immunization coverage and
timeliness. Further studies, however, are needed to better understand unique
regional preferences and assess the operational costs, long-term effects, and
risks of this intervention.

Presentation Attack Detection on Limited-Resource Devices Using Deep Neural
Classifiers Trained on Consistent Spectrogram Fragments.

Kubicki K(1), Kapusta P(1), Ślot K(1).

Author information:

The presented paper is concerned with detection of presentation attacks against
unsupervised remote biometric speaker verification, using a well-known
challenge-response scheme. We propose a novel approach to convolutional phoneme
classifier training, which ensures high phoneme recognition accuracy even for
significantly simplified network architectures, thus enabling efficient utterance
verification on resource-limited hardware, such as mobile phones or embedded
devices. We consider Deep Convolutional Neural Networks operating on windows of
speech Mel-Spectrograms as a means for phoneme recognition, and we show that one 
can boost the performance of highly simplified neural architectures by modifying 
the principle underlying training set construction. Instead of generating
training examples by slicing spectrograms using a sliding window, as it is
commonly done, we propose to maximize the consistency of phoneme-related
spectrogram structures that are to be learned, by choosing only spectrogram
chunks from the central regions of phoneme articulation intervals. This approach 
enables better utilization of the limited capacity of the considered simplified
networks, as it significantly reduces a within-class data scatter. We show that
neural architectures comprising as few as dozens of thousands parameters can
successfully-with accuracy of up to 76%, solve the 39-phoneme recognition task
(we use the English language TIMIT database for experimental verification of the 
method). We also show that ensembling of simple classifiers, using a basic
bagging method, boosts the recognition accuracy by another 2-3%, offering Phoneme
Error Rates at the level of 23%, which approaches the accuracy of the
state-of-the-art deep neural architectures that are one to two orders of
magnitude more complex than the proposed solution. This, in turn, enables
executing reliable presentation attack detection, based on just few-syllable long
challenges on highly resource-limited computing hardware.

The goal of the WrightBroS project is to design a system supporting the training 
of pilots in a flight simulator. The desired software should work on smart
glasses supplementing the visual information with augmented reality data,
displaying, for instance, additional training information or descriptions of
visible devices in real time. Therefore, the rapid recognition of observed
objects and their exact positioning is crucial for successful deployment. The
keypoint descriptor approach is a natural framework that is used for this
purpose. For this to be applied, the thorough examination of specific keypoint
location methods and types of keypoint descriptors is required first, as these
are essential factors that affect the overall accuracy of the approach. In the
presented research, we prepared a dedicated database presenting 27 various
devices of flight simulator. Then, we used it to compare existing
state-of-the-art techniques and verify their applicability. We investigated the
time necessary for the computation of a keypoint position, the time needed for
the preparation of a descriptor, and the classification accuracy of the
considered approaches. In total, we compared the outcomes of 12 keypoint location
methods and 10 keypoint descriptors. The best scores recorded for our database
were almost 96% for a combination of the ORB method for keypoint localization
followed by the BRISK approach as a descriptor.

Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is an unexpected sudden death due to a loss of heart
function and represents more than 50% of the deaths from cardiovascular diseases.
Since cardiovascular problems change the features in the electrical signal of the
heart, if significant changes are found with respect to a reference signal
(healthy), then it is possible to indicate in advance a possible SCD occurrence. 
This work proposes SCD identification using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and a
sparse representation technique. Moreover, the use of fixed feature ranking is
avoided by considering a dictionary as a flexible set of features where each
sparse representation could be seen as a dynamic feature extraction process. In
this way, the involved features may differ within the dictionary's margin of
similarity, which is better-suited to the large number of variations that an ECG 
signal contains. The experiments were carried out using the ECG signals from the 
MIT/BIH-SCDH and the MIT/BIH-NSR databases. The results show that it is possible 
to achieve a detection 30 min before the SCD event occurs, reaching an an
accuracy of 95.3% under the common scheme, and 80.5% under the proposed
multi-class scheme, thus being suitable for detecting a SCD episode in advance.

Heifers in Pasture.

Sensor technologies, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
produce huge amounts of data by tracking animal locations with high temporal
resolution. Due to this high resolution, all animals show at least some
co-occurrences, and the pure presence or absence of co-occurrences is not
satisfactory for social network construction. Further, tracked animal contacts
contain noise due to measurement errors or random co-occurrences. To identify
significant associations, null models are commonly used, but the determination of
an appropriate null model for GNSS data by maintaining the autocorrelation of
tracks is challenging, and the construction is time and memory consuming.
Bioinformaticians encounter phylogenetic background and random noise on
sequencing data. They estimate this noise directly on the data by using the
average product correction procedure, a method applied to information-theoretic
measures. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) data of heifers in a pasture, we 
performed a proof of concept that this approach can be transferred to animal
science for social network construction. The approach outputs stable results for 
up to 30% missing data points, and the predicted associations were in line with
those of the null models. The effect of different distance thresholds for contact
definition was marginal, but animal activity strongly affected the network
structure.

In recent times, as interest in stress control has increased, many studies on
stress recognition have been conducted. Several studies have been based on
physiological signals, but the disadvantage of this strategy is that it requires 
physiological-signal-acquisition devices. Another strategy employs
facial-image-based stress-recognition methods, which do not require devices, but 
predominantly use handcrafted features. However, such features have low
discriminating power. We propose a deep-learning-based stress-recognition method 
using facial images to address these challenges. Given that deep-learning methods
require extensive data, we constructed a large-capacity image database for stress
recognition. Furthermore, we used temporal attention, which assigns a high weight
to frames that are highly related to stress, as well as spatial attention, which 
assigns a high weight to regions that are highly related to stress. By adding a
network that inputs the facial landmark information closely related to stress, we
supplemented the network that receives only facial images as the input.
Experimental results on our newly constructed database indicated that the
proposed method outperforms contemporary deep-learning-based recognition methods.

Applying MMD Data Mining to Match Network Traffic for Stepping-Stone Intrusion
Detection.

31907, USA.

A long interactive TCP connection chain has been widely used by attackers to
launch their attacks and thus avoid detection. The longer a connection chain, the
higher the probability the chain is exploited by attackers. Round-trip Time (RTT)
can represent the length of a connection chain. In order to obtain the RTTs from 
the sniffed Send and Echo packets in a connection chain, matching the Sends and
Echoes is required. In this paper, we first model a network traffic as the
collection of RTTs and present the rationale of using the RTTs of a connection
chain to represent the length of the chain. Second, we propose applying MMD data 
mining algorithm to match TCP Send and Echo packets collected from a connection. 
We found that the MMD data mining packet-matching algorithm outperforms all the
existing packet-matching algorithms in terms of packet-matching rate including
sequence number-based algorithm, Yang's approach, Step-function, Packet-matching 
conservative algorithm and packet-matching greedy algorithm. The experimental
results from our local area networks showed that the packet-matching accuracy of 
the MMD algorithm is 100%. The average packet-matching rate of the MMD algorithm 
obtained from the experiments conducted under the Internet context can reach
around 94%. The MMD data mining packet-matching algorithm can fix the issue of
low packet-matching rate faced by all the existing packet-matching algorithms
including the state-of-the-art algorithm. It is applicable to network-based
stepping-stone intrusion detection.

Nowadays, a large number of students' academic registrations change every year in
universities, but most of these cases are recorded and mathematically and
statistically analysed through forms or systems, which are cumbersome and
difficult to find some potential information in them. Therefore, timely and
effective prediction of student registration changes and early warning of student
registration changes by technical means is an important part of university
registration management. At present, relevant research is mostly based on
mathematical statistical analysis methods such as students' current credit
evaluation or course score averages and seldom uses data mining and other
technical methods for in-depth research. In this paper, we propose a mutated
fuzzy neural network (MFNN) based prediction model for student registration
changes in colleges and universities, which can provide supplementary reference
decisions for school registration management for school teaching managers. In
this paper, we first construct the corresponding prediction model of academic
registration variation, define the relevant parameters, and model the
optimization problem and propose the objective optimization function. Second, the
proposed model is optimized by adding principal component analysis (PCA) to the
original model to improve the efficiency of model training and the correct
prediction rate. It is verified that the proposed model can effectively predict
individual students' academic registration changes with a prediction accuracy of 
nearly 92.91%.

BACKGROUND: The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Iran were reported in Qom
city. Subsequently, the neighboring provinces and gradually all 31 provinces of
Iran were involved. This study aimed to investigate the case fatility rate, basic
reproductive number in different period of epidemic, projection of daily and
cumulative incidence cases and also spatiotemporal mapping of SARS-CoV-2 in
Alborz province, Iran.
METHODS: A confirmed case of COVID-19 infection was defined as a case with a
positive result of viral nucleic acid testing in respiratory specimens. Serial
interval (SI) was fitted by gamma distribution and considered the
likelihood-based R0 using a branching process with Poisson likelihood. Seven days
average of cases, deaths, doubling times and CFRs used to draw smooth charts.
kernel density tool in Arc GIS (Esri) software has been employed to compute hot
spot area of the study site.
RESULTS: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.88 (95%, CI: 2.57-3.23) in the 
early 14 days of epidemic. The case fatility rate for Alborz province (Iran) on
March 10, was 8.33% (95%, CI:6.3-11), and by April 20, it had an increasing trend
and reached 12.9% (95%,CI:11.5-14.4). The doubling time has been increasing from 
about two days and then reached about 97 days on April 20, 2020, which shows the 
slowdown in the spread rate of the disease. Also, from March 26 to April 2, 2020 
the whole Geographical area of Karj city was almost affected by SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS: The R0 of COVID-19 in Alborz province was substantially high at the 
beginning of the epidemic, but with preventive measures and public education and 
GIS based monitoring of the cases,it has been reduced to 1.19 within two months. 
This reduction highpoints the attainment of preventive measures in place, however
we must be ready for any second epidemic waves during the next months.

BACKGROUND: Literature-based gene ontology (GO) annotation is a process where
expert curators use uniform expressions to describe gene functions reported in
research papers, creating computable representations of information about
biological systems. Manual assurance of consistency between GO annotations and
the associated evidence texts identified by expert curators is reliable but
time-consuming, and is infeasible in the context of rapidly growing biological
literature. A key challenge is maintaining consistency of existing GO annotations
as new studies are published and the GO vocabulary is updated.
RESULTS: In this work, we introduce a formalisation of biological database
annotation inconsistencies, identifying four distinct types of inconsistency. We 
propose a novel and efficient method using state-of-the-art text mining models to
automatically distinguish between consistent GO annotation and the different
types of inconsistent GO annotation. We evaluate this method using a synthetic
dataset generated by directed manipulation of instances in an existing corpus,
BC4GO. We provide detailed error analysis for demonstrating that the method
achieves high precision on more confident predictions.
CONCLUSIONS: Two models built using our method for distinct annotation
consistency identification tasks achieved high precision and were robust to
updates in the GO vocabulary. Our approach demonstrates clear value for
human-in-the-loop curation scenarios.

China.

Objective: To systematically evaluate and analyze the original research of
prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA), summarize its research progress
and methodological details, and provide a reference for the future use of this
method. Methods: The keywords related to PSSA were used for literature retrieval 
from Chinese databases (CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP) and English databases (PubMed,
Embase, and Cochrane). Original articles that were related to PSSA and published 
before June 30, 2020 were selected. Information form was developed by Excel.
Stata was used for the statistics analysis. Results: There were 45 eligible
articles included in the research. Since 2013, the number of studies using PSSA
has increased rapidly. These studies were mainly conducted in Japan (n=11,
24.44%), China (n=10, 22.22%), Denmark (n=9, 20.00%), and Australia (n=8,
17.78%). Medical claim database was used most commonly when PSSA was implemented.
The included studies involved 16 types of drugs, of which the number of studies
of psychotropic drugs and statins was highest (n=8, 17.78%), and adverse
reactions of almost all human systems were involved. In terms of methodology, 35 
(77.78%) and 43 (95.56%) studies clearly reported the run-in period and interval 
period, of which 14 (31.11%) and 9 (20.00%) respectively gave the method or
reason for determining the duration. In addition, 16 articles (35.56%) and 18
articles (40.00%) reported sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis results,
respectively. Conclusions: PSSA, one of the effective methods for safety signal
detection in healthcare databases, has developed rapidly, but the methodological 
details and result reporting need to be improved. In China, PSSA research is
still in its infancy, and it is necessary to pay attention to the quality of
research and promote methodological exploration.

To summarize the development and application of tree-based scan statistic
(TreeScan), explain the methodology and provide a reference for future use of
this method by reviewing the original pharmacoepidemiological and vaccine studies
using the TreeScan. Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases were used for
the retrieval of eligible studies using keywords related to TreeScan. A total of 
15 eligible studies were included, in which 9 studies explored the adverse events
of drugs and 6 studies focused on the safety of vaccines. Three types of models
(Poisson probability model, Bernoulli probability model and tree-temporal scan
statistic model) of TreeScan were used. The major differences among the three
models were 1) whether predefined control was used according to research
question, 2) whether the time from exposure to onset of adverse events was
considered. Several studies explored its ability by comparing with other methods 
for adverse event detection or by using known adverse events. This review shows
that TreeScan is an effective method for the safety signal detection of drugs or 
vaccines, which develops rapidly and globally. It is very necessary to promote
its use in drug safety monitoring and other related fields in China.

and Hospital, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India.

Aim: :To compare the crestal bone level of flapless technique of dental implant
placement with the flap technique.
Setting and Design: This Systematic review and Meta-analysis was conducted
according to the Preferred Reporting Items For Systematic Review and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines and registered with PROSPERO.
Materials and Methods: Electronic search of Medline and Google scholar databases 
for articles from 2010 till March 2020 was performed. Studies comparing the
crestal bone level with both the techniques were included. After the collection
of data, the risk of bias was assessed for each study.
Statistical Analysis Used: Meta-analysis was executed using RevMan 5 software
version 5.3.
Results: 23 studies were included. Statistically significant difference in
crestal bone level was found between flapless and flap surgery with mean
difference of -0.14 (flapless placement versus flap surgery; 95% CI: -0.24 to
-0.03; P = 0.01FNx01). The difference in crestal bone level between the 2 groups 
was not statistically significant with a mean difference of -0.05(Guided flapless
placement versus flap surgery; 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.00; P=0.06). Meta-analysis of
the freehand flapless surgery with flap surgery generated a mean difference of
-0.20 which was found to be statistically significant (Freehand flapless
placement versus flap surgery; 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.03; P=0.02FNx01).
Conclusions: Flapless placement of implant can positively influence crestal bone 
loss in comparison with conventional flap technique.

Comparison of functional outcome of simultaneous and staged bilateral total knee 
arthroplasty : systematic review of literature.

Qadir I, Khan L, Mazari J, Ahmed U, Zaman AU, Aziz A.

Safety of simultaneous bilateral TKA (simBTKA) and staged BTKA (staBTKA) have
been compared in previous systematic reviews but functional outcome remains
neglected aspect of the debate. We performed a systematic review of contemporary 
literature to compare the functional outcome of simBTKA and staBTKA. We searched 
PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Database to identify all articles
published between 2000 and July 2020 that evaluated the outcome of patients
undergoing BTKA either in simultaneous or staged manner. Ten articles were
identified which met the inclusion criteria. Functional outcome was reported in
terms of Knee Society score (KSS), range of motion (ROM), Oxford Knee Score (OKS)
and Western Ontario and McMaster University score (WOMAC) in seven, five, four
and two studies respectively. KSS gained on average 66.6 points (47.5-95.3) for
simBTKA and 65.1 points (44.4-97.2) for staBTKA without significant difference
between two groups. There was no difference in post-operative ROM (maximum
post-operative flexion being 124.4 and 125.1 for simBTKA and staBTKA groups
respectively). Mean improvement in OKS ranged from 20 to 32.6 for simBTKA and
21.6 to 33.1 for staBTKA. There was moderate evidence to suggest that both
simultaneous BTKA and staged BTKA produce equivalent improvement in functional
scores.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, Joint Hypermobility and Hypermobility Spectrum
Disorders.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an umbrella term for a clinically and genetically
heterogeneous group of hereditary soft connective tissue disorders mainly
featuring abnormal cutaneous texture (doughy/velvety, soft, thin, and/or variably
hyperextensible skin), easy bruising, and joint hypermobility. Currently,
musculoskeletal manifestations related to joint hypermobility are perceived as
the most prevalent determinants of the quality of life of affected individuals.
The 2017 International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and related
disorders identifies 13 clinical types due to deleterious variants in 19
different genes. Recent publications point out the possibility of a wider
spectrum of conditions that may be considered members of the Ehlers-Danlos
syndrome community. Most Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are due to inherited
abnormalities affecting the biogenesis of fibrillar collagens and other
components of the extracellular matrix. The introduction of next-generation
sequencing technologies in the diagnostic setting fastened patients'
classification and improved our knowledge on the phenotypic variability of many
Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. This is impacting significantly patients' management and
family counseling. At the same time, most individuals presenting with joint
hypermobility and associated musculoskeletal manifestations still remain without 
a firm diagnosis, due to a too vague clinical presentation and/or the lack of an 
identifiable molecular biomarker. These individuals are currently defined with
the term "hypermobility spectrum disorders". Hence, in parallel with a continuous
update of the International Classification of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the
scientific community is investing efforts in offering a more efficient framework 
for classifying and, hopefully, managing individuals with joint hypermobility.

University, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, China.

Objective: To investigate the influence of cold weather on setup errors of
patients with chest and pelvic disease in radiotherapy.
Methods: The image-guided data of the patients were collected from the
Radiotherapy Center of Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Guangxi Medical University
from October 2020 to February 2021. During this period, the cold weather days
were December 15, 16, and 17, 2020, and January 7 and 8, 2021. For body fixation 
in radiotherapy, an integrated plate and a thermoplastic mold were employed in 18
patients with chest disease, while an integrated plate and a vacuum pad were
applied in 19 patients with pelvic disease. All patients underwent cone beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans in the first five treatments and once a week
thereafter. The obtained data were registered to the planning CT image to get the
setup errors of the patient in the translational direction including X, Y, and Z 
axes and rotational direction including R X , R Y , and R Z . Then, the
Mann-Whitney U test was performed. The expansion boundary values of the chest and
pelvis were calculated according to the formula M PTV=2.5∑+0.7δ.
Results: A total of 286 eligible results of CBCT scans were collected. There were
138 chest CBCT scans, including 26 taken in cold weather and 112 in usual
weather, and 148 pelvic CBCT scans, including 33 taken in cold weather and 115 in
usual weather. The X-, Y-, and Z-axis translational setup errors of patients with
chest disease in the cold weather group were 0.16 (0.06, 0.32) cm, 0.25 (0.17,
0.52) cm, and 0.35 (0.21, 0.47) cm, respectively, and those in the usual weather 
group were 0.14 (0.08, 0.29) cm, 0.23 (0.13, 0.37) cm, and 0.18 (0.1, 0.35) cm,
respectively. The results indicated that there was a statistical difference in
the Z-axis translational error between the cold weather group and the usual
weather group (U = 935.5; p=0.005 < 0.05), while there was no statistical
difference in the rotational error between the two groups. The external boundary 
values of X, Y, and Z axes in the cold weather group were 0.57 cm, 0.92 cm, and
0.99 cm, respectively, and those in the usual weather group were 0.57 cm,
0.78 cm, and 0.68 cm, respectively. There was no significant difference in the
translational and rotational errors of patients with pelvic disease between the
cold weather group and the usual weather group (p < 0.05). The external boundary 
values of X, Y, and Z axes were 0.63 cm, 0.79 cm, and 0.68 cm in the cold weather
group and 0.61 cm, 0.79 cm, and 0.61 cm in the usual weather group, respectively.
Conclusion: The setup error of patients undergoing radiotherapy with their bodies
fixed by an integrated plate and a thermoplastic mold was greater in cold weather
than in usual weather, especially in the ventrodorsal direction.

Food quality and safety issues occurred frequently in recent years, which have
attracted more and more attention of social and international organizations.
Considering the increased quality risk in the food supply chain, many researchers
have applied various information technologies to develop real-time risk
identification and traceability systems (RITSs) for preferable food safety
guarantee. This paper presents an innovative approach by utilizing the
deep-stacking network method for hazardous risk identification, which relies on
massive multisource data monitored by the Internet of Things timely in the whole 
food supply chain. The aim of the proposed method is to help managers and
operators in food enterprises to find accurate risk levels of food security in
advance and to provide regulatory authorities and consumers with potential rules 
for better decision-making, thereby maintaining the safety and sustainability of 
food product supply. The verification experiments show that the proposed method
has the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy up to 97.62%, meanwhile 
achieves the appropriate model parameters only up to 211.26 megabytes. Moreover, 
the case analysis is implemented to illustrate the outperforming performance of
the proposed method in risk level identification. It can effectively enhance the 
RITS ability for assuring food supply chain security and attaining multiple
cooperation between regulators, enterprises, and consumers.

This study aimed to determine the optimal image reconstruction method for
preoperative computed tomography (CT) angiography for pulmonary segmentectomy.
This study enrolled 20 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced CT examination
for pulmonary segmentectomy. The optimal image reconstruction algorithm among
four different reconstruction algorithms (filtered back projection, hybrid
iterative reconstruction, model- based iterative reconstruction, and deep
learning reconstruction [DLR]) was investigated by assessing the CT numbers,
vessel extraction ratios, and misclassification ratios. The vessel extraction
ratios for main and subsegment branches reconstructed using DLR were
significantly higher than those using other reconstruction algorithms (96.7% and 
90.8% for pulmonary artery and vein, respectively). The misclassification ratios 
at the right upper lobe pulmonary vessels (V1 and V2) were especially high
because they were close to the superior vena cava, and their CT numbers were
similar in all four reconstructions. In conclusion, the DLR allows a high
extraction rate of pulmonary blood vessels and a low misclassification rate of
automatic extraction.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has become one of the most
severe pandemics in human history. In this paper, we propose to leverage social
media users as social sensors to simultaneously predict the pandemic trends and
suggest potential risk factors for public health experts to understand spread
situations and recommend proper interventions. More precisely, we develop novel
deep learning models to recognize important entities and their relations over
time, thereby establishing dynamic heterogeneous graphs to describe the
observations of social media users. A dynamic graph neural network model can then
forecast the trends (e.g. newly diagnosed cases and death rates) and identify
high-risk events from social media. Based on the proposed computational method,
we also develop a web-based system for domain experts without any computer
science background to easily interact with. We conduct extensive experiments on
large-scale datasets of COVID-19 related tweets provided by Twitter, which show
that our method can precisely predict the new cases and death rates. We also
demonstrate the robustness of our web-based pandemic surveillance system and its 
ability to retrieve essential knowledge and derive accurate predictions across a 
variety of circumstances. Our system is also available at
http://scaiweb.cs.ucla.edu/covidsurveiller/. This article is part of the theme
issue 'Data science approachs to infectious disease surveillance'.

A new tandem applicator with tungsten shield for Ir-192 radiation source used in 
intra-cavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) enabled intensity modulated brachytherapy
(IMBT) in cervical cancer treatment through fluence-modulation by rotating
shield. Our previous work employed group-wise and element-wise sparsity
constraints for plan optimization of tandem applicator to minimizes the number of
activated angles and source dwell points for delivery efficiency. It, however,
did not incorporate the ovoid applicators into the optimizing process, which is
generally used to prevent cancer recurrence. To integrate ovoid applicators to
the new tandem applicator, this work proposed a comprehensive framework that
modifies 1) dose deposition matrix for inverse planning, and 2) plan optimizing
algorithm. The dose deposition matrix was newly formulated by the Monte-Carlo
simulated dose distribution for 10 positions of ovoid applicators, followed by
combining those with tandem-associated dose deposition matrix. The plan
optimizing algorithm decomposed entire elements into tandem and ovoid
applicators, which were governed by different constraints adaptive to specified
plan objectives. The integrated framework was compared against conventional ICBT,
and IMBT with tandem only for three patients with asymmetric dose distributions. 
Integrated IMBT framework resulted in the most optimal plans. Including
fluence-modulation by rotating-shield outperformed conventional ICBT in dose
sparing to critical organs. Adopting ovoid applicators to the optimization
yielded more conformal dose distribution around inferior, laterally expanded
region of target volume. The resulting plans reduced D5cc and D2cc by 30.9% and
27.8% for critical organs over conventional ICBT, and by 20.6% and 21.5% for
target volume over IMBT with tandem only.

Chennai Port (13.099872° N, 80.297407° E), located along the southeast coast of
India, has been a hub for maritime trade since the fifteenth century. An
artificial harbour was initially constructed in 1881 which underwent numerous
expansions in the following years. The breakwaters of the harbour intercepted the
heavy sediment-laden littoral drift along the coast, resulting in the formation
of the world's second-longest urban beach south of the port, i.e. on its up-drift
side. Meanwhile, the coast north of the port, i.e. the down-drift side,
experienced intense erosion due to a lack of sediment supply and forces induced
on the coast due to waves and currents. The shoreline change study in this paper 
investigates a shoreline stretch of about 6 km (protected by transitional
groynes), north of Chennai Port by dividing it into three segments. The rate of
shoreline changes over a period of about 12 years across three different segments
was assessed using statistical parameters by employing remote sensing techniques 
complemented with geographical information system (GIS) and digital shoreline
analysis system (DSAS) tool. It is inferred that the coast has witnessed
accretion and sizable growth in beach width has been observed post the
construction of groyne field.

Early diagnosis of the harmful severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), along with clinical expertise, allows governments to break the
transition chain and flatten the epidemic curve. Although reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers quick results, chest
X-ray (CXR) imaging is a more reliable method for disease classification and
assessment. The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
triggered extensive research towards developing a COVID-19 detection toolkit.
Recent studies have confirmed that the deep learning-based approach, such as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provides an optimized solution for COVID-19
classification; however, they require substantial training data for learning
features. Gathering this training data in a short period has been challenging
during the pandemic. Therefore, this study proposes a new model of CNN and deep
convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) that classify CXR images
into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The proposed model contains eight
convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers,
which provide better results than the existing pretrained methods (AlexNet and
GoogLeNet). DCGAN performs two tasks: (1) generating synthetic/fake images to
overcome the challenges of an imbalanced dataset and (2) extracting deep features
of all images in the dataset. In addition, it enlarges the dataset and represents
the characteristics of diversity to provide a good generalization effect. In the 
experimental analysis, we used four distinct publicly accessible datasets of
chest X-ray images (COVID-19 X-ray, COVID Chest X-ray, COVID-19 Radiography, and 
CoronaHack-Chest X-Ray) to train and test the proposed CNN and the existing
pretrained methods. Thereafter, the proposed CNN method was trained with the four
datasets based on the DCGAN synthetic images, resulting in higher accuracy
(94.8%, 96.6%, 98.5%, and 98.6%) than the existing pretrained models. The overall
results suggest that the proposed DCGAN-CNN approach is a promising solution for 
efficient COVID-19 diagnosis.

A very important aspect for organizations that provide healthcare services is to 
have fully functional and successful information systems. A successful hospital
information system can contribute to high quality healthcare services provided to
the patients of the hospital. In this paper, is presented the evaluation of the
information system of Chios Hospital, "Skylitsio". The survey was conducted using
a questionnaire which consists demographic questions and questions that measure
the factors of the DeLone & McLean success model. The participants of the survey 
were 71 users of the clinical information system. Cronbach's alpha reliability
test, descriptive statistics, and further data analyses to investigate the
relations between the factors of the DeLone & McLean success model were
performed. Based on the results, the users of the information system are
satisfied with it, as well as they find the system useful and easy to use. The
average value of the "information quality" is 3.78 out of 5, the "system quality"
is 3.61, the "service quality" is 3.45, the "use" is 3.83, the "user
satisfaction" is 3.46, and the "user benefit" is 3.76. The research concludes
with a validation of the DeLone & McLean success model and it seems that the
information system of the General Hospital of Chios is successful based on the
users' opinions.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) implementing cancer clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) have the potential to improve the compliance of decisions made 
by multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTB) with CPGs. However, guideline-based CDSSs
do not cover complex cases and need time for discussion. We propose to learn how 
to predict complex cancer cases prior to MTBs from breast cancer patient
summaries (BCPSs) resuming clinical notes. BCPSs being unstructured natural
language textual documents, we implemented four semantic annotators (ECMT, SIFR, 
cTAKES, and MetaMap) to assess whether complexity-related concepts could be
extracted from clinical notes. On a sample of 24 BCPSs covering 35 complexity
reasons, ECMT and MetaMap were the most efficient systems with a performance rate
of 60% (21/35) and 49% (17/35), respectively. When using the four annotators in
sequence, 69% of complexity reasons were extracted (24/35 reasons).

Using guideline-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) has improved
clinical practice, especially during multidisciplinary tumour boards (MTBs) in
cancer patient management. However, MTBs have been reported to be overcrowded,
with limited time to discuss all cases. Complex breast cancer cases that need
further MTB discussions should have priority in the organization of MTBs. In
order to optimize MTB workflow, we attempted to predict complex cases defined as 
non-compliant cases despite the use of the decision support system OncoDoc. After
previously obtaining insufficient performance with machine learning algorithms,
we tested Multi Layer Perceptron for classification, compared various samplers to
compensate data imbalance combined with cross- validation, and optimized all
models with hyperparameter tuning and feature selection with no improvement and
lacklustre results (F1-score: 31.4%).

What Metadata? Defining Different Types of Digital Assets as Application Targets 
of Metadata in Clinical Research Informatics.

Löbe M(1).

Author information: 
(1)Institute for Medical Informatics (IMISE), University of Leipzig, Germany.

The term 'metadata' is mentioned in every one of the FAIR principles. Metadata is
without question important for findability, accessibility, and reusability, but
essential for interoperability. Standardized schemas have been developed by
various stakeholders for decades, but too rarely come to practical use. The
reason for this is that the application domain is not clearly understood. In many
bio-medical research projects, the need for metadata is recognized at some point,
but there is not only a lack of overview of existing standards, but also a lack
of correct assessment of what individual metadata schemas were actually made for.
This paper differentiates different application scenarios for metadata in
clinical research.

An infrastructure for the management of semantics is being developed to support
the regional health information exchange in Veneto - an Italian region which has 
about 5 million inhabitants. Terminology plays a key role in the management of
the information fluxes of the Veneto region, in which the management of
electronic health record is given great attention. An architecture for the
management of the semantics of laboratory reports has been set up, adopting
standards by HL7. The system has been initially developed according to the common
terminology service release 2 (CTS2) standard and, in order to overcome
complexities of CTS2 is being revised according to the Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which has been subsequently
introduced. Aspects of CST2 and of FHIR have been considered in order to retain
most suitable aspects of both. This integration can be regarded as most
worthwhile.

Recent studies demonstrated that comparative analysis of stem cell research data 
sets originating from multiple studies can produce new information and help with 
hypotheses generation. Effective approaches for incorporating multiple diverse
heterogeneous data sets collected from stem cell projects into a harmonized
project-based framework have been lacking. Here, we provide an intelligent
informatics solution for integrating comprehensive characterizations of stem
cells with research subject and project outcome information. Our platform is the 
first to seamlessly integrate information from iPSCs and cancer stem cell
research into a single platform, using a multi-modular common data element
framework. Heterogeneous data is validated using predefined ontologies and stored
in a relational database, to ensure data quality and ease of access. Testing was 
performed using 103 published, publicly-available iPSC and cancer stem cell
projects conducted in clinical, preclinical and in vitro evaluations. We
validated the robustness of the platform, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse data 
elements, and demonstrated its potential for knowledge generation through the
aggregation and harmonization of data. Future aims of this project include
increasing the database size using crowdsourcing and natural language processing 
functionalities. The platform is publicly available at https://remedy.mssm.edu/.

Assessing Resolvability and Consistency in OBO Foundry Ontologies: Pilot Study.

Zhang S(1), Benis N(1), Cornet R(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Medical Informatics, Amsterdam University Medical Center,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

Ontologies listed in the OBO Foundry are often regarded as reliable choices to be
reused but ontology interoperability of them remains unknown. This study
evaluated the resolvability of URIs and consistency of axioms in the OBO Foundry 
library, BFO ontology, and CIDO ontology. All had nonresolvable URIs, but the OBO
library and the CIDO had additional interoperability issues regarding the use of 
incorrect prefixes, mixing up with ontologies, and inconsistency in the use of
property. These detected issues reflected the real-world common problems that
were not significant from human beings' point of view but hindered the
machine-processability of ontologies. The assessment performed in this study was 
automated and enables scale-up against more metrics over more ontologies, which
remains future work.

The use of international laboratory terminologies inside hospital information
systems is required to conduct data reuse analyses through inter-hospital
databases. While most terminology matching techniques performing semantic
interoperability are language-based, another strategy is to use distribution
matching that performs terms matching based on the statistical similarity. In
this work, our objective is to design and assess a structured framework to
perform distribution matching on concepts described by continuous variables. We
propose a framework that combines distribution matching and machine learning
techniques. Using a training sample consisting of correct and incorrect
correspondences between different terminologies, a match probability score is
built. For each term, best candidates are returned and sorted in decreasing order
using the probability given by the model. Searching 101 terms from Lille
University Hospital among the same list of concepts in MIMIC-III, the model
returned the correct match in the top 5 candidates for 96 of them (95%). Using
this open-source framework with a top-k suggestions system could make the expert 
validation of terminologies alignment easier.

Generating evidence based on real-world data is gaining importance in research
not least since the COVID-19 pandemic. The Common Data Model of Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) is a research infrastructure that implements 
FAIR principles. Although the transfer of German claim data to OMOP is already
implemented, drug data is an open issue. This paper provides a concept to prepare
electronic health record (EHR) drug data for the transfer to OMOP based on
requirements analysis and descriptive statistics for profiling EHR data developed
by an interdisciplinary team and also covers data quality issues. The concept not
only ensures FAIR principles for research, but provides the foundation for German
drug data to OMOP transfer.

Hip arthroplasty represents a large proportion of orthopaedic activity,
constantly increasing. Automating monitoring from clinical data warehouses is an 
opportunity to dynamically monitor devices and patient outcomes allowing improve 
clinical practices. Our objective was to assess quantitative and qualitative
concordance between claim data and device supply data in order to create an
e-cohort of patients undergoing a hip replacement. We performed a single-centre
cohort pilot study, from one clinical data warehouse of a French University
Hospital, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019. We included all adult
patients undergoing a hip arthroplasty, and with at least one hip medical device 
provided. Patients younger than 18 years or opposed to the reuse of their data
were excluded from the analysis. Our primary outcome was the percentage of
hospital stays with both hip arthroplasty and hip device provided. The patient
and stay characteristics assessed in this study were: age, sex, length of stay,
surgery procedure (replacement, repositioning, change, or reconstruction),
medical motif for surgery (osteoarthritis, fracture, cancer, infection, or other)
and device provided (head, stem, shell, or other). We found 3,380 stays and 2,934
patients, 96.4% of them had both a hip surgery procedure and a hip device
provided. These data from different sources are close enough to be integrated in 
a common clinical data warehouse.

We present a user acceptance study of a clinical decision support system (CDSS)
for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk prediction. We focus on how a
combination of data-driven and rule-based models influence the efficiency and
acceptance by doctors. To evaluate the perceived usefulness, we randomly
generated CDSS output in three different settings: Data-driven (DD) model output;
DD model with a presence of known risk scale (FINDRISK); DD model with presence
of risk scale and explanation of DD model. For each case, a physician was asked
to answer 3 questions: if a doctor agrees with the result, if a doctor
understands it, if the result is useful for the practice. We employed a Lankton's
model to evaluate the user acceptance of the clinical decision support system.
Our analysis has proved that without the presence of scales, a physician trust
CDSS blindly. From the answers, we can conclude that interpretability plays an
important role in accepting a CDSS.

Federated learning has a great potential to create solutions working over
different sources without data transfer. However current federated methods are
not explainable nor auditable. In this paper we propose a Federated data mining
method to discover association rules. More accurately, we define what we consider
as interesting itemsets and propose an algorithm to obtain them. This approach
facilitates the interoperability and reusability, and it is based on the
accessibility to data. These properties are quite aligned with the FAIR
principles.

BACKGROUND: Care for people with an Intellectual Disability (ID) is complex:
multiple health care professionals are involved and use different Health
Information Systems (HISs) to store medical and daily care information on the
same individuals. The objective of this study is to identify the HISs needs of
professionals in ID care by addressing the obstacles and challenges they meet in 
their current HISs.
METHODS: We distributed an online questionnaire amongst Dutch ID care
professionals via different professional associations and care providers. 328
respondents answered questions on their HISs. An inventory was made of HIS usage 
purposes, problems, satisfaction and desired features, with and without
stratification on type of HIS and care professional.
RESULTS: Typical in ID care, two types of HISs are being used that differ with
respect to their features and users: Electronic Client Dossiers (ECDs) and
Electronic Patient Dossiers (EPDs). In total, the respondents mentioned 52 unique
HISs. Groups of care professionals differed in their satisfaction with ECDs only.
Both HIS types present users with difficulties related to the specifics of care
for people with an ID. Particularly the much needed communication between the
many unique HISs was reported a major issue which implies major issues with
inter-operability. Other problems seem design-related as well.
CONCLUSION: This study can be used to improve current HISs and design new HISs
that take ID care professionals requirements into account.

The effects of bronchoscopy and chest CT on early evaluation of patients with
hemoptysis are still controversial. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library
databases were systematically searched. Odds ratio (OR) was applied to assess the
utility of bronchoscopy for hemoptysis etiology and site in comparison with CT in
the various clinical processes. A total of 23 studies were included (N=4635). The
results showed that bronchoscopy implied a lower overall diagnostic accuracy,
especially in identifying the etiology of hemoptysis, compared with CT (OR= 0.34,
95% CI: [0.23, 0.51], OR=0.21, 95% CI: [0.14, 0.31], respectively). When the
results of radiograph were normal, the effectiveness of bronchoscopy was
significantly weaker than that of CT (OR=0.32, 95% CI: [0.22, 0.45]). In the
cases of massive hemoptysis, bronchoscopy and CT had no statistical significance 
for identifying bleeding (OR=0.27, 95% CI: [0.02, 3.18]). The study suggested
that bronchoscopy did not show superior diagnostic accuracy than CT for patients 
with hemoptysis at the first visit. Key Words: Hemoptysis, Bronchoscopy, CT,
Meta-analysis.

University, Trabzon, Turkey.

Due to Turkey's reliance on imported electricity, it has been using hydroelectric
power plants (HPPs) to cover some of its electrical energy needs since 2011.
However, HPP projects, which do not take landscape sensitivity into account,
cause the ecological integrity of the basins and the ecosystem structure to
deteriorate. This study presents the Tokat-Niksar HPP project field example in
Turkey's Central Black Sea region with its steep slopes, rich forest and creek
vegetation, protected endemic plants and wildlife, cultural heritage dating back 
to 3000 BC agricultural activities, and long-established local culture. The
study, in fact, aims to develop a landscape restoration plan that considers the
sensitivity of landscapes in the HPP project area. For this purpose, a landscape 
sensitivity analysis consisting of water, habitat, visibility, erosion functions,
and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) determining priority of functions
conducted with experts were performed. According to the results, the water
function was found to have the highest, and the visibility the lowest priority in
the ranking. Consequently, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-degree sensitive areas with
very high, high, and moderate landscape sensitivity were determined by weighted
sum function by considering the priority of each landscape function, and
accordingly, a five-stage landscape restoration model was developed including
soil protection, areas to be protected, erosion control, vegetation screening,
and creek reclamation. This study presents a framework for sustainable landscape 
restoration solutions in the town by combining landscape sensitivity analysis via
MCDA.

Automated dispensing cabinet (ADC) overrides are used to access emergent or
urgent medications when time delay from computerized provider order entry may
result in patient harm. [1] Although necessary, ADC overrides bypass the safety
features of order entry and verification which increase the risk of an error
occurring and potential patient harm. To protect patient safety, national
organizations such as The Joint Commission and Institute for Safe Medication
Practices have called for hospitals to review overriding trends and available
medications on override. AdventHealth Central Florida Division - South (CFD-S)
met the recommendations to track overrides but there was limited understanding of
the data. A quality improvement project was necessary to
investigate the division's risk of error and identify interventions to
proactively limit patient risk. The initial task of the quality improvement
project was to create a standardized ADC override report that could be shared
with pharmacy and nursing leaders within AdventHealth CFD-S monthly. As the
project progressed, multiple interventions were identified such as standardizing 
the information reflected in the report, improving education about ADC overrides 
across multi-disciplinary departments, and critically reviewing the data to
identify needed changes within the division. The efforts to share the ADC
override metrics across all levels has improved understanding of ADC override
goals and intentions of monitoring ADC overrides. This has paved the path to
improving ADC override unit culture and identify gaps within the system that
allows overrides to occur.

compare registration, publication, and outcome reporting among pivotal clinical
trials that supported FDA approval of high-risk (class III) cardiovascular
devices before and after the FDA Amendment Act (FDAAA) was enacted in 2007.
METHODS: Using publicly available data from ClinicalTrials.gov , FDA summaries,
and PubMed, we determined registration, publication, and reporting of findings
for all pivotal clinical studies supporting FDA approval of new high-risk
cardiovascular devices between 2005 and 2020, before and after FDAAA. For
published studies, we compared both the primary efficacy outcome with the FDA's
Premarket Approval (PMA) primary efficacy outcome and the published
interpretation of findings with the FDA reviewer's interpretation (positive,
equivocal, or negative).
RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2020, the FDA approved 156 high-risk cardiovascular
devices on the basis of 165 pivotal trials, 48 (29%) of which were categorized as
pre-FDAAA and 117 (71%) as post-FDAAA. Post-FDAAA, pivotal clinical trials were
more likely to be registered (115 of 117 (98%) vs 24 of 48 (50%); p < 0.001), to 
report results (98 of 117 (87%) vs 7 of 48 (15%); p < 0.001) on
ClinicalTrials.gov , and to be published (100 or 117 (85%) vs 28 of 48 (58%); p
< 0.001) in peer-reviewed literature when compared to pre-FDAAA. Among published 
trials, rates of concordant primary efficacy outcome reporting were not
significantly different between pre-FDAAA trials and post-FDAAA trials (24 of 28 
(86%) vs 96 of 100 (96%); p = 0.07), nor were rates of concordant trial
interpretation (27 of 28 (96%) vs 93 of 100 (93%); p = 0.44).
CONCLUSIONS: FDAAA was associated with increased registration, result reporting, 
and publication for trials supporting FDA approval of high-risk medical devices. 
Among published trials, rates of accurate primary efficacy outcome reporting and 
trial interpretation were high and no different post-FDAAA.

BACKGROUND: A lot of medical mentions can be extracted from a huge amount of
medical texts. In order to make use of these medical mentions, a prerequisite
step is to link those medical mentions to a medical domain knowledge base (KB).
This linkage of mention to a well-defined, unambiguous KB is a necessary part of 
the downstream application such as disease diagnosis and prescription of drugs.
Such demand becomes more urgent in colloquial and informal situations like online
medical consultation, where the medical language is more casual and vaguer. In
this article, we propose an unsupervised method to link the Chinese medical
symptom mentions to the ICD10 classification in a colloquial background.
METHODS: We propose an unsupervised entity linking model using multi-instance
learning (MIL). Our approach builds on a basic unsupervised entity linking method
(named BEL), which is an embedding similarity-based EL model in this paper, and
uses MIL training paradigm to boost the performance of BEL. First, we construct a
dataset from an unlabeled large-scale Chinese medical consultation corpus with
the help of BEL. Subsequently, we use a variety of encoders to obtain the
representations of mention-context and the ICD10 entities. Then the
representations are fed into a ranking network to score candidate entities.
RESULTS: We evaluate the proposed model on the test dataset annotated by
professional doctors. The evaluation results show that our method achieves 60.34%
accuracy, exceeding the fundamental BEL by 1.72%.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose an unsupervised entity linking method to the entity
linking in the medical domain, using MIL training manner. We annotate a test set 
for evaluation. The experimental results show that our model behaves better than 
the fundamental model BEL, and provides an insight for future research.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, the
use of deep learning technology for clinical information extraction has become a 
new trend. Clinical Event Detection (CED) as its subtask has attracted the
attention from academia and industry. However, directly applying the advancements
in deep learning to CED task often yields unsatisfactory results. The main
reasons are due to the following two points: (1) A great number of obscure
professional terms in the electronic medical record leads to poor recognition
performance of model. (2) The scarcity of datasets required for the task leads to
poor model robustness. Therefore, it is urgent to solve these two problems to
improve model performance.
METHODS: This paper proposes a combining data augmentation and domain information
with TENER Model for Clinical Event Detection.
RESULTS: We use two evaluation metrics to compare the overall performance of the 
proposed model with the existing model on the 2012 i2b2 challenge dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best
F1-score of 80.26%, type accuracy of 93% and Span F1-score of 90.33%, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposes a multi-granularity information fusion
encoder-decoder framework, which applies the TENER model to the CED task for the 
first time. It uses the pre-trained language model (BioBERT) to generate
word-level features, solving the problem of a great number of obscure
professional terms in the electronic medical record lead to poor recognition
performance of model. In addition, this paper proposes a new data augmentation
method for sequence labeling tasks, solving the problem of the scarcity of
datasets required for the task leads to poor model robustness.

BACKGROUND: Drug repurposing is to find new indications of approved drugs, which 
is essential for investigating new uses for approved or investigational drug
efficiency. The active gene annotation corpus (named AGAC) is annotated by human 
experts, which was developed to support knowledge discovery for drug repurposing.
The AGAC track of the BioNLP Open Shared Tasks using this corpus is organized by 
EMNLP-BioNLP 2019, where the "Selective annotation" attribution makes AGAC track 
more challenging than other traditional sequence labeling tasks. In this work, we
show our methods for trigger word detection (Task 1) and its thematic role
identification (Task 2) in the AGAC track. As a step forward to drug repurposing 
research, our work can also be applied to large-scale automatic extraction of
medical text knowledge.
METHODS: To meet the challenges of the two tasks, we consider Task 1 as the
medical name entity recognition (NER), which cultivates molecular phenomena
related to gene mutation. And we regard Task 2 as a relation extraction task,
which captures the thematic roles between entities. In this work, we exploit
pre-trained biomedical language representation models (e.g., BioBERT) in the
information extraction pipeline for mutation-disease knowledge collection from
PubMed. Moreover, we design the fine-tuning framework by using a multi-task
learning technique and extra features. We further investigate different
approaches to consolidate and transfer the knowledge from varying sources and
illustrate the performance of our model on the AGAC corpus. Our approach is based
on fine-tuned BERT, BioBERT, NCBI BERT, and ClinicalBERT using multi-task
learning. Further experiments show the effectiveness of knowledge transformation 
and the ensemble integration of models of two tasks. We conduct a performance
comparison of various algorithms. We also do an ablation study on the development
set of Task 1 to examine the effectiveness of each component of our method.
RESULTS: Compared with competitor methods, our model obtained the highest
Precision (0.63), Recall (0.56), and F-score value (0.60) in Task 1, which ranks 
first place. It outperformed the baseline method provided by the organizers by
0.10 in F-score. The model shared the same encoding layers for the named entity
recognition and relation extraction parts. And we obtained a second high F-score 
(0.25) in Task 2 with a simple but effective framework.
CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results on the benchmark annotation of genes with
active mutation-centric function changes corpus show that integrating pre-trained
biomedical language representation models (i.e., BERT, NCBI BERT, ClinicalBERT,
BioBERT) into a pipe of information extraction methods with multi-task learning
can improve the ability to collect mutation-disease knowledge from PubMed.

BACKGROUND: With the rapid increase in the amount of Protein-Protein Interaction 
(PPI) data, the establishment of an event-centered PPI ontology that contains
temporal and spatial vocabularies is urgently needed to clarify PPI biological
annotations. In this paper, we propose a precisely designed schema - PPIO (PPI
Ontology) for representing the biological context of PPIs.
RESULTS: Inspired by the event model and the distinct characteristics of PPI
events, PPIO consists of six core aspects of the information required for
reporting a PPI event, including the interactor (who), the biological process
(when), the subcellular location (where), the interaction type (how), the
biological function (what) and the detection method (which). PPIO is implemented 
through the integration of appropriate terms from the corresponding
vocabularies/ontologies, e.g., Gene Ontology, Protein Ontology, PSI-MI/MOD, etc. 
To assess PPIO, an approach based on PPIO in developed to extract PPI biological 
annotations from an open standard corpus "BioCreAtIvE-PPI". The experiment
results demonstrate PPIO's high performance, a precision of 0.69, a recall of
0.72 and an F-score of 0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: PPIO is a well-constructed essential ontology in the interpretation 
of PPI biological context. The results of the experiments conducted on the
BioCreAtIvE corpus demonstrate that PPIO is able to facilitate PPI annotation
extraction from biomedical literature effectively and enrich essential annotation
for PPIs.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to appraise the capacity of serum
aminotransferases to discriminate between hepatic and other extra-pulmonary
COVID-19-related manifestations and, potentially, to serve as predictors of poor 
clinical outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight studies were identified (79% from China),
including 43,554 patients (57% males), 9,983 (62% males) with poor outcomes and
33,571 (50% males) with favorable outcomes. After splitting studies depending on 
whether serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were statistically
different between patients with poor vs. favorable outcomes, the 35 'hepatic
involvement' articles (p<0.05) included 28,510 patients (51% males), 5,279 (66%
males) and 23,231 subjects (48% males) with poor and favorable outcomes,
respectively. The 63 'extra-hepatic involvement' studies (p>0.05) included 15,044
patients (54% males), 4,704 (60% males) with poor outcomes and 10,340 (51% males)
with favorable outcomes.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis shows that serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
concentrations were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes than
those with favorable outcomes (WMD 12.5 UI/L, 95% CI 10.9 to 14.1 p<0.001).
Similarly, AST concentrations were significantly higher in the 'hepatic
involvement' studies (WMD 16.3 UI/L, 95% CI 13.4 to 19.2 p<0.001) and in the
'extra-hepatic involvement' studies (WMD 10.3 UI/L, 95% CI 8.6 to 12.0 p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The different association of serum AST concentrations with some
clinical, demographic, and biochemical factors in the two clusters suggests that 
in COVID-19 patients, serum AST elevation is not necessarily linked to real liver
damage.

PURPOSE: We developed an x-ray-opaque-marker (XOM) system with inserted fiducial 
markers for patient-specific quality assurance (QA) in CyberKnife (Accuray) and a
general-purpose linear accelerator (linac). The XOM system can be easily inserted
or removed from the existing patient-specific QA phantom. Our study aimed to
assess the utility of the XOM system by evaluating the recognition accuracy of
the phantom position error and estimating the dose perturbation around a marker.
METHODS: The recognition accuracy of the phantom position error was evaluated by 
comparing the known error values of the phantom position with the values measured
by matching the images with target locating system (TLS; Accuray) and on-board
imager (OBI; Varian). The dose perturbation was evaluated for 6 and 10 MV
single-photon beams through experimental measurements and Monte Carlo
simulations.
RESULTS: The root mean squares (RMSs) of the residual position errors for the
recognition accuracy evaluation in translations were 0.07 mm with TLS and 0.30 mm
with OBI, and those in rotations were 0.13° with TLS and 0.15° with OBI. The dose
perturbation was observed within 1.5 mm for 6 MV and 2.0 mm for 10 MV from the
marker.
CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient recognition accuracy of the phantom position error was
achieved using our system. It is unnecessary to consider the dose perturbation in
actual patient-specific QA. We concluded that the XOM system can be utilized to
ensure quantitative and accurate phantom positioning in patient-specific QA with 
CyberKnife and a general-purpose linac.

OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic/clinical inertia is thought to be responsible for up to
80% of cardiovascular events. This study was conducted as a comprehensive scoping
and bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed scholarly documents reporting on
factors associated with therapeutic/clinical inertia in caring for patients with 
hypertension. Additionally, this study identified the factors associated with
therapeutic/clinical inertia in hypertension.
STUDY DESIGN: This study was a scoping and bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: The databases MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL/EBSCO, Cochrane, and Scopus
were searched from inception to September 23, 2020, using relevant keywords.
Documents reporting on factors associated with therapeutic/clinical inertia in
caring for patients with hypertension were selected based on inclusion criteria. 
Bibliometric indicators and VOSviewer were used to analyze and map citation and
keyword networks.
RESULTS: Data were collected from 71 documents. Of those, 43 (60.6%) were
original articles, 54 (76.1%) were published after 2010, and 41 (57.7%)
originated from the United States. Mapping cooccurrence of terms identified 112
hot topics that were grouped into 4 clusters. A total of 41 factors associated
with therapeutic/clinical inertia were identified from the documents selected. Of
those, 23 (56.1%) were related to the physician, 12 (29.3%) were related to the
patient, and 6 (14.6%) were related to the health care system.
CONCLUSIONS: This scoping and bibliometric study provides insights into the width
and depth of scholarly peer-reviewed documents on factors associated with
therapeutic/clinical inertia in caring for patients with hypertension. Findings
of this study could be helpful in shaping future directions of research into
therapeutic/clinical inertia in hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Syncope evaluation and management is associated with testing overuse 
and unnecessary hospitalizations. The 2017 American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Syncope Guideline aims to
standardize clinical practice and reduce unnecessary services. The use of
clinical decision support (CDS) tools offers the potential to successfully
implement evidence-based clinical guidelines. However, CDS tools that provide an 
evidence-based differential diagnosis (DDx) of syncope at the point of care are
currently lacking.
OBJECTIVE: With input from diverse health systems, we developed and demonstrated 
the viability of a mobile app, the Multilevel Implementation Strategy for Syncope
optImal care thrOugh eNgagement (MISSION) Syncope, as a CDS tool for syncope
diagnosis and prognosis.
METHODS: Development of the app had three main goals: (1) reliable generation of 
an accurate DDx, (2) incorporation of an evidence-based clinical risk tool for
prognosis, and (3) user-based design and technical development. To generate a DDx
that incorporated assessment recommendations, we reviewed guidelines and the
literature to determine clinical assessment questions (variables) and likelihood 
ratios (LHRs) for each variable in predicting etiology. The creation and
validation of the app diagnosis occurred through an iterative clinician review
and application to actual clinical cases. The review of available risk score
calculators focused on identifying an easily applied and valid evidence-based
clinical risk stratification tool. The review and decision-making factors
included characteristics of the original study, clinical variables, and
validation studies. App design and development relied on user-centered design
principles. We used observations of the emergency department workflow, storyboard
demonstration, multiple mock review sessions, and beta-testing to optimize
functionality and usability.
RESULTS: The MISSION Syncope app is consistent with guideline recommendations on 
evidence-based practice (EBP), and its user interface (UI) reflects steps in a
real-world patient evaluation: assessment, DDx, risk stratification, and
recommendations. The app provides flexible clinical decision making, while
emphasizing a care continuum; it generates recommendations for diagnosis and
prognosis based on user input. The DDx in the app is deemed a pragmatic model
that more closely aligns with real-world clinical practice and was validated
using actual clinical cases. The beta-testing of the app demonstrated
well-accepted functionality and usability of this syncope CDS tool.
CONCLUSIONS: The MISSION Syncope app development integrated the current
literature and clinical expertise to provide an evidence-based DDx, a prognosis
using a validated scoring system, and recommendations based on clinical
guidelines. This app demonstrates the importance of using research literature in 
the development of a CDS tool and applying clinical experience to fill the gaps
in available research. It is essential for a successful app to be deliberate in
pursuing a practical clinical model instead of striving for a perfect
mathematical model, given available published evidence. This hybrid methodology
can be applied to similar CDS tool development.

With the rapid development of information technology, hospital informatization
has become the general trend. In this context, disease monitoring based on
medical big data has been proposed and has aroused widespread concern. In order
to overcome the shortcomings of the BP neural network, such as slow convergence
speed and easy to fall into local extremum, simulated annealing algorithm is used
to optimize the BP neural network and high-order simulated annealing neural
network algorithm is constructed. After screening the potential target indicators
using the random forest algorithm, based on medical big data, the experiment uses
high-order simulated annealing neural network algorithm to establish the obesity 
monitoring model to realize obesity monitoring and prevention. The results show
that the training times of the SA-BP neural network are 1480 times lower than
those of the BP neural network, and the mean square error of the SA-BP neural
network is 3.43 times lower than that of the BP neural network. The MAE of the
SA-BP neural network is 1.81 times lower than that of the BP neural network, and 
the average output error of the obesity monitoring model is about 2.35 at each
temperature. After training, the average accuracy of the obesity monitoring model
was 98.7%. The above results show that the obesity monitoring model based on
medical big data can effectively complete the monitoring of obesity and has a
certain contribution to the diagnosis, treatment, and early warning of obesity.

The current Internet data explosion is expecting an ever-higher demand for text
emotion analysis that greatly facilitates public opinion analysis and trend
prediction, among others. Therefore, this paper proposes to use a dual-channel
convolutional neural network (DCNN) algorithm to analyze the semantic features of
English text big data. Following the analysis of the effect of CNN, artificial
neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) on English text data
analysis, the more effective long short-term memory (LSTM) and the gated
recurrent unit (GRU) neural network (NN) are introduced, and each network is
combined with the dual-channel CNN, respectively, and comprehensively analyzed
under comparative experiments. Second, the semantic features of English text big 
data are analyzed through the improved SO-pointwise mutual information (SO-PMI)
algorithm. Finally, the ensemble dual-channel CNN model is established. Under the
comparative experiment, GRU NN has a better feature detection effect than LSTM
NN, but the performance increase from dual-channel CNN to GRU NN + dual-channel
CNN is not obvious. Under the comparative analysis of GRU NN + dual-channel CNN
model and LSTM NN + dual-channel CNN model, GRU NN + dual-channel CNN model
ensures the high accuracy of semantic feature analysis and improves the analysis 
speed of the model. Further, after the attention mechanism is added to the GRU
NN + dual-channel CNN model, the accuracy of semantic feature analysis of the
model is improved by nearly 1.3%. Therefore, the ensemble model of GRU
NN + dual-channel CNN + attention mechanism is more suitable for semantic feature
analysis of English text big data. The results will help the e-commerce platform 
to analyze the evaluation language and semantic features for the current network 
English short texts.

BACKGROUND: Src-related kinase lacking C-terminal regulatory tyrosine and
N-terminal myristoylation sites (SRMS) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that has
been found to be overexpressed in various tumors. However, the role of SRMS in
colorectal cancer (CRC) has not been well established.
METHODS: We evaluated the expression levels of SRMS in CRC using GEPIA, Oncomine,
and HPA datasets. Survival information and gene expression data of CRC were
obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Then, the association between SRMS 
and clinicopathological features was analyzed using UALCAN dataset. LinkedOmics
was used to determine co-expression and functional networks associated with SRMS.
Besides, we used TISIDB to assess the correlation between SRMS and immune
signatures, including tumor-infiltrating immune cells and immunomodulators.
Lastly, protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was established and the
function enrichment analysis of the SRMS-associated immunomodulators and immune
cell marker genes were performed using the STRING portal.
RESULTS: Compared to normal colorectal tissues, SRMS was found to be
overexpressed in CRC tissues, which was correlated with a poor prognosis. In
colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), the expression levels of SRMS are significantly
correlated with pathological stages and nodal metastasis status. Functional
network analysis suggested that SRMS regulates intermediate filament-based
processes, protein autophosphorylation, translational initiation, and elongation 
signaling through pathways involving ribosomes, proteasomes, oxidative
phosphorylation, and DNA replication. In addition, SRMS expression was correlated
with infiltrating levels of CD4+ T cells, CD56dim, MEM B, Neutrophils, Th2, Th17,
and Act DC. The gene ontology (GO) analysis of SRMS-associated immunomodulators
and immune cell marker genes showed that they were mainly enriched in the immune 
microenvironment molecule-related signals. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of these genes indicated that they are
involved in multiple cancer-related pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: SRMS is a promising prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic
target for CRC patients. In particular, SRMS regulates CRC progression by
modulating cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokines, IL-17, and
intestinal immune networks for IgA production signaling pathways among others.
However, more studies are needed to validate these findings.

All approved coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in current use are
safe, effective, and reduce the risk of severe illness. Although data on the
immunological presentation of patients with COVID-19 is limited, increasing
experimental evidence supports the significant contribution of B and T cells
towards the resolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection. Despite the availability of several COVID-19 vaccines
with high efficacy, more effective vaccines are still needed to protect against
the new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Employing a comprehensive immunoinformatic
prediction algorithm and leveraging the genetic closeness with SARS-CoV, we have 
predicted potential immune epitopes in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The
S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVs are main targets of antibody
detection and have motivated us to design four multi-epitope vaccines which were 
based on our predicted B- and T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. 
The cardinal epitopes selected for the vaccine constructs are predicted to
possess antigenic, non-allergenic, and cytokine-inducing properties.
Additionally, some of the predicted epitopes have been experimentally validated
in published papers. Furthermore, we used the C-ImmSim server to predict
effective immune responses induced by the epitope-based vaccines. Taken together,
the immune epitopes predicted in this study provide a platform for future
experimental validations which may facilitate the development of effective
vaccine candidates and epitope-based serological diagnostic assays.

BACKGROUND: Patient-centered health care information systems (PHSs) enable
patients to take control and become knowledgeable about their own health,
preferably in a secure environment. Current and emerging PHSs use either a
centralized database, peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, or distributed ledger
technology for PHS deployment. The evolving COVID-19 decentralized
Bluetooth-based tracing systems are examples of disease-centric P2P PHSs.
Although using P2P technology for the provision of PHSs can be flexible,
scalable, resilient to a single point of failure, and inexpensive for patients,
the use of health information on P2P networks poses major security issues as
users must manage information security largely by themselves.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the inherent security issues for PHS
deployment in P2P networks and how they can be overcome. In addition, this study 
reviews different P2P architectures and proposes a suitable architecture for P2P 
PHS deployment.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines.
Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. We searched the following
databases: IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library,
Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The search was conducted on articles published
between 2008 and 2020. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System was used as a
guide for rating security issues.
RESULTS: Our findings are consolidated into 8 key security issues associated with
PHS implementation and deployment on P2P networks and 7 factors promoting them.
Moreover, we propose a suitable architecture for P2P PHSs and guidelines for the 
provision of PHSs while maintaining information security.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the clear advantages of P2P PHSs, the absence of centralized
controls and inconsistent views of the network on some P2P systems have profound 
adverse impacts in terms of security. The security issues identified in this
study need to be addressed to increase patients' intention to use PHSs on P2P
networks by making them safe to use.

In this study we propose a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) mathematical model
that stratifies infectious subpopulations into: infectious asymptomatic
individuals, symptomatic infectious individuals who manifest mild symptoms and
symptomatic individuals with severe symptoms. In light of the recent revelation
that reinfection by COVID-19 is possible, the proposed model attempt to
investigate how reinfection with COVID-19 will alter the future dynamics of the
recent unfolding pandemic. Fitting the mathematical model on the Kenya COVID-19
dataset, model parameter values were obtained and used to conduct numerical
simulations. Numerical results suggest that reinfection of recovered individuals 
who have lost their protective immunity will create a large pool of asymptomatic 
infectious individuals which will ultimately increase symptomatic individuals
with mild symptoms and symptomatic individuals with severe symptoms (critically
ill) needing urgent medical attention. The model suggests that reinfection with
COVID-19 will lead to an increase in cumulative reported deaths. Comparison of
the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions on curbing COVID19 proliferation
suggests that wearing face masks profoundly reduce COVID-19 prevalence than
maintaining social/physical distance. Further, numerical findings reveal that
increasing detection rate of asymptomatic cases via contact tracing, testing and 
isolating them can drastically reduce COVID-19 surge, in particular individuals
who are critically ill and require admission into intensive care.

BACKGROUND: Communication challenges contribute to medication incidents in
hospitals, but it is unclear how communication can be improved. The aims of this 
study were threefold: firstly, to describe the most common communication
challenges related to medication incidents as perceived by healthcare
professionals across specialized hospitals for adult patients; secondly, to
consider suggestions from healthcare professionals with regard to improving
medication communication; and thirdly, to explore how text mining compares to
manual analysis when analyzing the free-text content of survey data.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study. A digital survey was sent
to professionals in two university hospital districts in Finland from November 1,
2019, to January 31, 2020. In total, 223 professionals answered the open-ended
questions; respondents were primarily registered nurses (77.7 %), physicians
(8.6 %), and pharmacists (7.3 %). Text mining and manual inductive content
analysis were employed for qualitative data analysis.
RESULTS: The communication challenges were: (1) inconsistent documentation of
prescribed and administered medication; (2) failure to document orally given
prescriptions; (3) nurses' unawareness of prescriptions (given outside of ward
rounds) due to a lack of oral communication from the prescribers; (4) breaks in
communication during care transitions to non-communicable software; (5)
incomplete home medication reconciliation at admission and discharge; (6)
medication lists not being updated during the inpatient period due to a lack of
clarity regarding the responsible professional; and (7) work/environmental
factors during medication dispensation and the receipt of verbal prescriptions.
Suggestions for communication enhancements included: (1) structured digital
prescriptions; (2) guidelines and training on how to use documentation systems;
(3) timely documentation of verbal prescriptions and digital documentation of
administered medication; (4) communicable software within and between
organizations; (5) standardized responsibilities for updating inpatients'
medication lists; (6) nomination of a responsible person for home medication
reconciliation at admission and discharge; and (7) distraction-free work
environment for medication communication. Text mining and manual analysis
extracted similar primary results.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-communicable software, non-standardized medication communication
processes, lack of training on standardized documentation, and unclear
responsibilities compromise medication safety in hospitals. Clarification is
needed regarding interdisciplinary medication communication processes,
techniques, and responsibilities. Text mining shows promise for free-text
analysis.

BACKGROUND: Novartis and the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute (BDI) have
established a research alliance with the aim to improve health care and drug
development by making it more efficient and targeted. Using a combination of the 
latest statistical machine learning technology with an innovative IT platform
developed to manage large volumes of anonymised data from numerous data sources
and types we plan to identify novel patterns with clinical relevance which cannot
be detected by humans alone to identify phenotypes and early predictors of
patient disease activity and progression.
METHOD: The collaboration focuses on highly complex autoimmune diseases and
develops a computational framework to assemble a research-ready dataset across
numerous modalities. For the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) project, the collaboration
has anonymised and integrated phase II to phase IV clinical and imaging trial
data from ≈35,000 patients across all clinical phenotypes and collected in more
than 2200 centres worldwide. For the "IL-17" project, the collaboration has
anonymised and integrated clinical and imaging data from over 30 phase II and III
Cosentyx clinical trials including more than 15,000 patients, suffering from four
autoimmune disorders (Psoriasis, Axial Spondyloarthritis, Psoriatic arthritis
(PsA) and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)).
RESULTS: A fundamental component of successful data analysis and the
collaborative development of novel machine learning methods on these rich data
sets has been the construction of a research informatics framework that can
capture the data at regular intervals where images could be anonymised and
integrated with the de-identified clinical data, quality controlled and compiled 
into a research-ready relational database which would then be available to
multi-disciplinary analysts. The collaborative development from a group of
software developers, data wranglers, statisticians, clinicians, and domain
scientists across both organisations has been key. This framework is innovative, 
as it facilitates collaborative data management and makes a complicated clinical 
trial data set from a pharmaceutical company available to academic researchers
who become associated with the project.
CONCLUSIONS: An informatics framework has been developed to capture clinical
trial data into a pipeline of anonymisation, quality control, data exploration,
and subsequent integration into a database. Establishing this framework has been 
integral to the development of analytical tools.

PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe), an international
not-for-profit association that brings together the five largest European
supercomputing centers and involves 26 European countries, has allocated more
than half a billion core hours to computer simulations to fight the COVID-19
pandemic. Alongside experiments, these simulations are a pillar of research to
assess the risks of different scenarios and investigate mitigation strategies.
While the world deals with the subsequent waves of the pandemic, we present a
reflection on the use of urgent supercomputing for global societal challenges and
crisis management.

Multiple Damage Detection of an Offshore Helideck through the Two-Step Artificial
Neural Network Based on the Limited Mode Shape Data.

A helideck is an essential structure in an offshore platform, and it is crucial
to maintain its structural integrity and detect the occurrence of damage early.
Because helidecks usually consist of complex lattice truss members, precise
measurements are required for structural health monitoring based on accurate
modal parameters. However, available sensors and data acquisition are limited.
Therefore, we propose a two-step damage detection process using an artificial
neural network. Based on the mode shape database collected from 137,400 damage
scenarios by finite element analysis, the neural network in the first step was
trained to estimate the mode shapes of the entire helideck model using the
selected mode shape data obtained from the limited measuring points. Then, the
neural network in the second step is consecutively trained to detect the location
and amount of structural damage to individual parts. As a result, it is shown
that the proposed procedure provides the damage detection capability with only a 
quarter of the entire mode shape data, while the estimation accuracy is
sufficiently high compared to the single network directly trained using all mode 
shape data. It was also found that, compared to the network directly trained from
the same data, the proposed technique tends to detect minor damages more
accurately.

A wide range of applications based on sequential data, named time series, have
become increasingly popular in recent years, mainly those based on the Internet
of Things (IoT). Several different machine learning algorithms exploit the
patterns extracted from sequential data to support multiple tasks. However, this 
data can suffer from unreliable readings that can lead to low accuracy models due
to the low-quality training sets available. Detecting the change point between
high representative segments is an important ally to find and thread biased
subsequences. By constructing a framework based on the Augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) test for data stationarity, two proposals to automatically segment
subsequences in a time series were developed. The former proposal, called Change 
Detector segmentation, relies on change detection methods of data stream mining. 
The latter, called ADF-based segmentation, is constructed on a new change
detector derived from the ADF test only. Experiments over real-file IoT databases
and benchmarks showed the improvement provided by our proposals for prediction
tasks with traditional Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Deep 
Learning (Long short-term memory and Temporal Convolutional Networks) methods.
Results obtained by the Long short-term memory predictive model reduced the
relative prediction error from 1 to 0.67, compared to time series without
segmentation.

Electronic performance tracking devices are largely employed in team sports to
monitor performance and improve training. To date, global positioning system
(GPS) based devices are those mainly used in soccer training. The aim of this
study was to analyse the validity and reliability of the inertial sensor device
(ISD) in monitoring distance and speed in a soccer-specific circuit and how their
performance compare to a GPS system. 44 young male soccer players (age: 14.9 ±
1.1, range 9-16, years, height: 1.65 ± 0.10 m, body mass: 56.3 ± 8.9 kg) playing 
in a non-professional soccer team in Italy, participated in the study. We
assessed the players trough a soccer running sport-specific circuit. An ISD and a
GPS were used to assess distance and speed. Data was compared to a video
reference system, and the difference were quantified by means of the root mean
square error (RMSE). Significant differences were found for both GPS and ISD
devices for distance and speed. However, lower error for distance (dRMSE 2.23 ±
1.01 m and 5.75 ± 1.50 m, respectively) and speed (sRMSE 0.588 ± 0.152 m·s-1 and 
1.30 ± 0.422 m·s-1, respectively) were attained by the ISD compared to the GPS.
Overall, our results revealed a statistically significant difference between
systems in data monitoring for either distance and speed. However, results of
this study showed that a smaller error was obtained with the ISD than the GPS
device. Despite caution is warranted within the interpretation of these results, 
we observed a better practical applicability of the ISD due to its small size,
lower cost and the possibility to use the device indoor.

Convolutional neural networks have become one of the most powerful computing
tools of artificial intelligence in recent years. They are especially suitable
for the analysis of images and other data that have an inherent sequence
structure, such as time series data. In the case of data in the form of vectors
of features, the order of which does not matter, the use of convolutional neural 
networks is not justified. This paper presents a new method of representing
non-sequential data as images that can be analyzed by a convolutional network.
The well-known Kohonen network was used for this purpose. After training on
non-sequential data, each example is represented by so-called U-image that can be
used as input to a convolutional layer. A hybrid approach was also presented,
where the neural network uses two types of input signals, both U-image
representation and the original features. The results of the proposed method on
traditional machine learning databases as well as on a difficult classification
problem originating from the analysis of measurement data from experiments in
particle physics are presented.

Coasts are areas of vitality because they host numerous activities worldwide.
Despite their major importance, the knowledge of the main characteristics of the 
majority of coastal areas (e.g., coastal bathymetry) is still very limited. This 
is mainly due to the scarcity and lack of accurate measurements or observations, 
and the sparsity of coastal waters. Moreover, the high cost of performing
observations with conventional methods does not allow expansion of the monitoring
chain in different coastal areas. In this study, we suggest that the advent of
remote sensing data (e.g., Sentinel 2A/B) and high performance computing could
open a new perspective to overcome the lack of coastal observations. Indeed,
previous research has shown that it is possible to derive large-scale coastal
bathymetry from S-2 images. The large S-2 coverage, however, leads to a high
computational cost when post-processing the images. Thus, we develop a
methodology implemented on a High-Performance cluster (HPC) to derive the
bathymetry from S-2 over the globe. In this paper, we describe the
conceptualization and implementation of this methodology. Moreover, we will give 
a general overview of the generated bathymetry map for NA compared with the
reference GEBCO global bathymetric product. Finally, we will highlight some
hotspots by looking closely to their outputs.

Critical Infrastructures (CIs) are sensible targets. They could be physically
damaged by natural or human actions, causing service disruptions, economic
losses, and, in some extreme cases, harm to people. They, therefore, need a high 
level of protection against possible unintentional and intentional events. In
this paper, we show a logical architecture that exploits information from both
physical and cybersecurity systems to improve the overall security in a power
plant scenario. We propose a Machine Learning (ML)-based anomaly detection
approach to detect possible anomaly events by jointly correlating data related to
both the physical and cyber domains. The performance evaluation showed
encouraging results-obtained by different ML algorithms-which highlights how our 
proposed approach is able to detect possible abnormal situations that could not
have been detected by using only information from either the physical or cyber
domain.

Like Smart Home and Smart Devices, Smart Navigation has become necessary to
travel through the congestion of the structure of either building or in the wild.
The advancement in smartphone technology and incorporation of many different
precise sensors have made the smartphone a unique choice for developing practical
navigation applications. Many have taken the initiative to address this by
developing mobile-based solutions. Here, a cloud-based intelligent traveler
assistant is proposed that exploits user-generated position and elevation data
collected from ubiquitous smartphone devices equipped with Accelerometer,
Gyroscope, Magnetometer, and GPS (Global Positioning System) sensors. The data
can be collected by the pedestrians and the drivers, and are then automatically
put into topological information. The platform and associated innovative
application allow travelers to create a map of a route or an infrastructure with 
ease and to share the information for others to follow. The cloud-based solution 
that does not cost travelers anything allows them to create, access, and follow
any maps online and offline. The proposed solution consumes little battery power 
and can be used with lowly configured resources. The ability to create unknown,
unreached, or unrecognized rural/urban road maps, building structures, and the
wild map with the help of volunteer traveler-generated data and to share these
data with the greater community makes the presented solution unique and valuable.
The proposed crowdsourcing method of knowing the unknown would be an excellent
support for travelers.

Use of a multi-sensor approach can provide citizens with holistic insights into
the air quality of their immediate surroundings and their personal exposure to
urban stressors. Our work, as part of the ICARUS H2020 project, which included
over 600 participants from seven European cities, discusses the data fusion and
harmonization of a diverse set of multi-sensor data streams to provide a
comprehensive and understandable report for participants. Harmonizing the data
streams identified issues with the sensor devices and protocols, such as
non-uniform timestamps, data gaps, difficult data retrieval from commercial
devices, and coarse activity data logging. Our process of data fusion and
harmonization allowed us to automate visualizations and reports, and consequently
provide each participant with a detailed individualized report. Results showed
that a key solution was to streamline the code and speed up the process, which
necessitated certain compromises in visualizing the data. A thought-out process
of data fusion and harmonization of a diverse set of multi-sensor data streams
considerably improved the quality and quantity of distilled data that a research 
participant received. Though automation considerably accelerated the production
of the reports, manual and structured double checks are strongly recommended.

The identification of vulnerable people and places to flood is crucial for
effective disaster risk management. Here, we combine flood hazard and social
vulnerability index to capture the potential risk of flood. In this paper,
Nanjing was taken as the case study to explore the spatial pattern of social
vulnerability towards flood at the community scale by developing an index system.
Based on the flood risk results of ArcSWAT, the risk of flood disaster in Nanjing
was evaluated. The results show the following. (1) Social vulnerability exhibits 
a central-peripheral pattern in general, which means that the social
vulnerability degree is high in the central city and decreases gradually to the
suburbs. (2) The susceptibility to flood disaster has a similar circle-layer
pattern that is the highest in the urban centre, lower in the exurban areas, and 
the lowest in the suburb areas. (3) By using the GIS-based zoning approach,
communities are classified into four types by comprehensively considering their
flood susceptibility and social vulnerability. The spatial pattern is explained, 
and policy recommendation for reducing flood risk is provided for each type of
community. The research has important reference significance for identifying the 
spatial pattern of social vulnerability to flood and then formulating targeted
adaptation countermeasures.

Online mental health service (OMHS) platforms have contributed significantly to
the public's mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. However, it
remains unclear why the public used OMHS platforms for psychological help-seeking
(PHS) behavior and how PHS behavior varied across different stages of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the ecological PHS behavior data from two OMHS
platforms, we extracted population, psychological problems, and influential
factors of PHS behavior by text mining and time series analysis methods. Seven
top-ranked psychological problems (i.e., depression and anxiety, lack of
interest, suicidal tendencies, social phobia, feelings of being worried and
afraid, suffering, anger) and seven influential factors (i.e., interpersonal
relationships, love, family, work, psychotherapy, personal characteristics,
marriage) were found. The online PHS behaviors related to different psychological
problems and influential factors remained a growing trend before 2020 and have
been increasing significantly due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Four main stages were
found during the pandemic according to the changes in the online PHS population: 
sharp growth, significant decline, slight rebound, and slow decline. This study
identified large-scale, spontaneous PHS behaviors among the online public during 
the COVID-19 pandemic and the various psychological problems and influential
factors that varied across different stages of the pandemic, suggesting that the 
government and health practitioners should adopt effective policies and
strategies to prevent and intervene in mental health problems for the online
public.

Population-based data linkage has a long history in Australia from its beginnings
in Western Australia in the 1970s to the coordinated national data linkage
infrastructure that exists today. This article describes the journey from an idea
to a national data linkage network which has impacts on the health and well-being
of Australians from preventing developmental anomalies to responding to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Many enthusiastic and dedicated people have contributed to
Australia's data linkage capability over the last 50 years. They have managed to 
overcome a number of challenges including gaining stakeholder and community
support; navigating complex legal and ethical environments; establishing
cross-jurisdictional collaborations, and gaining ongoing financial support. The
future is bright for linked data in Australia as the infrastructure built over
the last 50 years provides a firm foundation for further expansion and
development, ensuring that Australia's linked health and human services data
continues to be available to address the evolving challenges of the next half
century.

(1) Background: The appearance of physician rating websites (PRWs) has raised
researchers' interest in the online healthcare field, particularly how users
consume information available on PRWs in terms of online physician reviews and
providers' information in their decision-making process. The aim of this study is
to consistently review the early scientific literature related to digital
healthcare platforms, summarize key findings and study features, identify
literature deficiencies, and suggest digital solutions for future research. (2)
Methods: A systematic literature review using key databases was conducted to
search published articles between 2010 and 2020 and identified 52 papers that
focused on PRWs, different signals in the form of PRWs' features, the findings of
these studies, and peer-reviewed articles. The research features and main
findings are reported in tables and figures. (3) Results: The review of 52 papers
identified 22 articles for online reputation, 15 for service popularity, 16 for
linguistic features, 15 for doctor-patient concordance, 7 for offline reputation,
and 11 for trustworthiness signals. Out of 52 studies, 75% used quantitative
techniques, 12% employed qualitative techniques, and 13% were mixed-methods
investigations. The majority of studies retrieved larger datasets using machine
learning techniques (44/52). These studies were mostly conducted in China (38),
the United States (9), and Europe (3). The majority of signals were positively
related to the clinical outcomes. Few studies used conventional surveys of
patient treatment experience (5, 9.61%), and few used panel data (9, 17%). These 
studies found a high degree of correlation between these signals with clinical
outcomes. (4) Conclusions: PRWs contain valuable signals that provide insights
into the service quality and patient treatment choice, yet it has not been
extensively used for evaluating the quality of care. This study offers
implications for researchers to consider digital solutions such as advanced
machine learning and data mining techniques to test hypotheses regarding a
variety of signals on PRWs for clinical decision-making.

Neonatal "surgical" malformations are associated with higher costs than major
"non-surgical" birth defects. We aimed to analyze the financial burden on the
Austrian health system of five congenital malformations requiring timely
postnatal surgery. The database of the Austrian National Public Health Institute 
for the period from 2002 to 2014 was reviewed. Diagnosis-related group (DRG)
points assigned to hospital admissions containing five congenital malformations
coded as principal diagnosis (esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia, congenital
diaphragmatic hernia, gastroschisis, and omphalocele) were collected and compared
to all hospitalizations for other reasons. Out of 3,518,625 total
hospitalizations, there were 1664 admissions of patients with the selected
malformations. The annual mean number was 128 (SD 17, range 110-175). The mean
cost of the congenital malformations per hospital admission expressed in DRG
points was 26,588 (range 0-465,772, SD 40,702) and was significantly higher
compared to the other hospitalizations (n = 3,516,961; mean DRG 2194, range
0-834,997; SD 6161; p < 0.05). Surgical conditions requiring timely postnatal
surgery place a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. The
creation of a dedicated national register could allow for better planning of
resource allocation, for improving the outcome of affected children, and for
optimizing costs.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection. It
causes patients to stay longer in the hospital and increases medical costs. This 
study explores the effect of applying an automatic medical information system to 
implement five-item prevention care bundles on the prevention of
ventilator-related pneumonia. This study was a retrospective cohort study. This
study was conducted from October 2017 to February 2018 and collected data from
the intensive care unit of a medical center in southern Taiwan from January 2013 
to May 2016. The control group (enrolled from January 2013 to June 2014) received
oral hygiene. The experimental group (enrolled from July 2014 to December 2015)
received five-item ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention care bundles, which
consisted of (1) elevation of the head of the bed to 30-45°; (2) daily oral care 
with 0.12-0.2% chlorhexidine twice daily; (3) daily assessment of readiness to
extubate; (4) daily sedative interruption; and (5) emptying water from the
respirator tube. Results showed the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia 
in the bundle group was significantly less than the oral hygiene group (p =
0.029). The factors that significantly affected the incidence of
ventilator-associated pneumonia were ventilator-associated pneumonia care bundle,
ventilator-days, and intensive care unit length of stay. A significant reduction 
in ventilator-associated pneumonia rate in the bundle group compared to the oral 
hygiene group (OR = 0.366, 95% CI = 0.159-0.840) was observed, with 63.4%
effectiveness. Application of an automatic medical information system to
implement bundle care can significantly reduce the incidence of
ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor used by SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses to attach to cells via the receptor-binding domain (RBD)
of their viral spike protein. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, several
structures of protein complexes involving ACE2 and RBD as well as monoclonal
antibodies and nanobodies have become available. We have leveraged the structural
data to design peptides to target the interaction between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
and ACE2 and SARS-CoV and ACE2, as contrasting exemplar, as well as the
dimerization surface of ACE2 monomers. The peptides were modelled using our
original method: PiPreD that uses native elements of the interaction between the 
targeted protein and cognate partner(s) that are subsequently included in the
designed peptides. These peptides recapitulate stretches of residues present in
the native interface plus novel and highly diverse conformations surrogating key 
interactions at the interface. To facilitate the access to this information we
have created a freely available and dedicated web-based repository, PepI-Covid19 
database, providing convenient access to this wealth of information to the
scientific community with the view of maximizing its potential impact in the
development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents.

Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most common cause of tumor-related death.
Chemotherapy resistance usually occurs, leading to cancer relapse and poor
survival of GC patients. To investigate the role of miRNAs in chemotherapy
resistance for GC patients, we conducted an integrated analysis of miRNA
expression and survival information using data obtained from The Cancer Genome
Atlas project. Genome-wide screening of chemotherapy response-specific miRNAs was
performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for patients who
received chemotherapy or those who had never received chemotherapy, respectively.
A four-miRNA expression signature (involving two protective miRNAs, miR-200b and 
miR-103a, and two risk ones miR-199 and miR-152) was predicted as a specific
indicator for GC chemoresistance (p = 0.00053; hazard ratio = 8.63),
outperforming those clinicopathological factors. Functional experiments confirmed
the roles of these signature miRNAs in regulation of chemotherapy response.
Functional enrichment of these signature miRNAs and risk score revealed positive 
association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and negative
association with cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage response. Furthermore, the 
immune infiltration-miRNA functional network analysis revealed transformation
from activated effector cells to resting immunosuppressive cells are preferred in
GCs with adverse chemotherapy response. In summary, our work identifies a
four-miRNA expression signature as a promising chemoresistance biomarker in GC,
which provides novel insights into developing new strategies to overcome GC
chemoresistance.

Infantile methemoglobinemia, thyroid disorders, and probably some carcinogenic
effects are health concerns associated with dietary nitrate. Isfahan province has
a dry and semi-arid desert climate such that the main source of various
applications in this province is groundwater resources. This study evaluated
spatial analysis of the groundwater NO3- concentrations and its possible health
risk to residents. Method 8171 Hach was used for nitrate measurement of 1319
groundwater samples from March 2018 to February 2019. Non-carcinogenic risk due
to NO3- exposure through consumption of drinking water was assessed, and the
associated zoning maps were presented using geographic information system (GIS). 
Nitrate concentrations in the rural and urban areas were within 0.4-137 mg/L NO3-
and 2.9-209 mg/L NO3-, respectively. Also, 226 (25%) and 104 (24%) of samples in 
the rural and urban areas, respectively, were detected above the Iran and WHO
guideline NO3- values of 50 mg/L. The highest levels of NO3-, which were found in
the western and central groundwater resources, occurred in the agricultural and
residential areas. The NO3- concentrations were higher in urban than rural areas 
in the many studied counties. Also, nitrate was higher in wet seasons than in dry
ones. Infants' non-carcinogenic risks were higher than the other groups. Infants 
(HQ > 1) were the most vulnerable group compared with the other groups in some
counties. Thus, there are potential risks of methemoglobinemia, especially for
infants. It is critical to adopt specific strategies to reduce the nitrate
concentration in the studied groundwater.

Recent studies have shown that a tumor's biological response to radiation varies 
over time and has a dynamic nature. Dynamic biological features of tumor cells
underscore the importance of using fractionation and adapting the treatment plan 
to tumor volume changes in radiation therapy treatment. Adaptive radiation
therapy (ART) is an iterative process to adjust the dose of radiation in response
to potential changes during the treatment. One of the key challenges in ART is
how to determine the optimal timing of adaptations corresponding to tumor
response to radiation. This paper aims to develop an automated treatment planning
framework incorporating the biological uncertainties to find the optimal
adaptation points to achieve a more effective treatment plan. First, a dynamic
tumor-response model is proposed to predict weekly tumor volume regression during
the period of radiation therapy treatment based on biological factors. Second, a 
Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework is developed to find the optimal adaptation
points for ART considering the uncertainty in biological factors with the goal of
achieving maximum final tumor control while minimizing or maintaining the
toxicity level of the organs at risk (OARs) per the decision-maker's preference. 
Third, a beamlet intensity optimization model is solved using the predicted tumor
volume at each adaptation point. The performance of the proposed RT treatment
planning framework is tested using a clinical non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
case. The results are compared with the conventional fractionation schedule
(i.e., equal dose fractionation) as a reference plan. The results show that the
proposed approach performed well in achieving a robust optimal ART treatment plan
under high uncertainty in the biological parameters. The ART plan outperformed
the reference plan by increasing the mean biological effective dose (BED) value
of the tumor by 2.01%, while maintaining the OAR BED within +0.5% and reducing
the variability, in terms of the interquartile range (IQR) of tumor BED, by 25%.

This study proposes a novel real-time frequency-independent myocardial infarction
detector for Lead II electrocardiograms. The underlying Deep-LSTM network is
trained using the PTB-XL database, the largest to date publicly available
electrocardiography dataset, and is tested over the same and the older PTB
database. By testing the model over distinct datasets, collected under different 
conditions and from different patients, a more realistic measure of the
performance can be gauged from the deployed system. The detector is trained over 
3589 myocardial infarction (MI) patients and 7115 healthy controls (HC) while it 
is evaluated on 1076 MIs and 1840 HCs. The proposed algorithm, achieved an
accuracy of 77.12%, recall/sensitivity of 75.85%, and a specificity of 83.02%
over the entire PTB database; 85.07%, 81.54%, 87.31% over the PTB-XL validation
set (fold 9), and 84.17%, 78.37%, 87.55% over the PTB-XL test set (fold 10). The 
model also achieves stable performance metrics over the frequency range of 202 Hz
to 2.8 kHz. The processing time is dependent on the sampling frequency, ranging
from 130 ms at 202 Hz to 1.8 s at 2.8 kHz. Such outcome is within the time
required for real-time processing (less than 300 ms for fast heartbeats), between
202 Hz and 500 Hz making the algorithm practically real-time. Therefore, the
proposed MI detector could be readily deployed onto existing wearable and/or
portable devices and test instruments; potentially having significant societal
and clinical impact in the lives of patients at risk for myocardial infarction.

Melanoma is an aggressive neoplasm responsible for the majority of deaths from
skin cancer. Specifically, spitzoid melanocytic tumors are one of the most
challenging melanocytic lesions due to their ambiguous morphological features.
The gold standard for its diagnosis and prognosis is the analysis of skin
biopsies. In this process, dermatopathologists visualize skin histology slides
under a microscope, in a highly time-consuming and subjective task. In the last
years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have emerged as a promising tool
that could support pathologists in daily clinical practice. Nevertheless, no
automatic CAD systems have yet been proposed for the analysis of spitzoid
lesions. Regarding common melanoma, no system allows both the selection of the
tumor region and the prediction of the benign or malignant form in the diagnosis.
Motivated by this, we propose a novel end-to-end weakly supervised deep learning 
model, based on inductive transfer learning with an improved convolutional neural
network (CNN) to refine the embedding features of the latent space. The framework
is composed of a source model in charge of finding the tumor patch-level
patterns, and a target model focuses on the specific diagnosis of a biopsy. The
latter retrains the backbone of the source model through a multiple instance
learning workflow to obtain the biopsy-level scoring. To evaluate the performance
of the proposed methods, we performed extensive experiments on a private skin
database with spitzoid lesions. Test results achieved an accuracy of 0.9231 and
0.80 for the source and the target models, respectively. In addition, the heat
map findings are directly in line with the clinicians' medical decision and even 
highlight, in some cases, patterns of interest that were overlooked by the
pathologist.

BACKGROUND: Electronic medical records are widely used in family practices across
Canada and can improve health outcomes. However, recent reports indicate that
physicians using electronic medical records work longer and have less direct
patient contact which may contribute to burnout. Therefore, new and innovative
digital tools are essential to reduce physician workloads and improve
patient-physician interaction to address physician burnout. The objective of this
study was to assess the efficiency and accuracy of clinical decision-making when 
using a new preventive care point-of-care clinical decision support system
(CDSS). An estimate of the potential annual time savings was also determined.
This study also assessed physician reported perceived usefulness and ease of use 
of the CDSS.
METHODS: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during this study. Each
participant evaluated two simulated patient charts and identified which
preventive care metrics were due. The participants recorded their decisions and
the time required to assess each chart. Participants then completed a Technology 
Acceptance Model survey regarding the perceived usefulness and ease of use of the
CDSS, which included qualitative feedback. The amount of time saved was
determined and participants' clinical decision-making accuracy was scored against
current Canadian preventive care guidelines. The number of preventive care
specific visits completed per year was determined using clinic billing data.
RESULTS: The preventive care CDSS saved an average of 195.7 s of chart review
time (249.5 s vs 445.2 s; P < 0.001). A total of 1520 preventive visits were
performed at Primrose and Bruyère Family Medicine Centres. Extrapolated across
the organization, implementation of the new tool could save 82.6 h per year.
Decision-making accuracy was not affected by the new tool (78.4% vs 80.9%,
P > 0.05). Participants rated the perceived ease of use and usefulness to be very
high.
CONCLUSIONS: New digital tools may reduce providers' workload without impacting
clinical decision-making accuracy. Participants indicated that the preventive
care CDSS was useful and easy to use. Further software development and clinical
studies are required to further improve and characterize the effect this new CDSS
has when implemented in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD
(AECOPD) can cause a significant decrease in patient lung function, and are the
main reason for hospitalization and death of patients with COPD. This study aims 
to use bibliometric methods to analyze the characteristics of AECOPD related
research in the past 10 years [2010-2020] and provide references for future
research.
METHODS: This study used subject terms to search AECOPD-related documents
published in 2010-2020 in the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database.
The search terms were "AECOPD" or "acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease." We use the CiteSpace software to analyze the target
literature records. The analysis includes: the annual distribution of literature 
publications, the distribution of published literature sources (including
countries, institutions, journals, and authors), and using keywords.
RESULTS: A total of 3,785 articles on AECOPD were published between 2010 and
2020, with 62,162 citations. Both the number of published documents and the
number of citations has increased with time. The literature mainly comes from
several developed countries, including European and North American countries, and
the cooperation between institutions and authors in these countries is relatively
close. The main journals are the top journals of respiratory specialty and the
top comprehensive journals. The results of the keyword analysis show that the
current research is on risk factors, biomarkers, and AECOPD management.
CONCLUSIONS: AECOPD research tends to focus on a precise diagnosis and treatment,
and prevention of AECOPD in patients with COPD should be paid more attention.

Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the active ingredients and potential
mechanism of our hospital's Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) experiential
prescription in the treatment of GBS based on network pharmacology.
METHODS: The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology (TCMSP) database
was used to screen the active ingredients of the eight traditional Chinese
medicines (TCMs) of the GBS-experiential prescription, and the Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM), GeneCards, and MalaCards databases were used to obtain
GBS-related gene targets. The common targets of the experiential prescriptions
and GBS-related gene targets were acquired and imported into the STRING database 
to obtain the protein interaction relationship. Gene oncology (GO) function and
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were
performed to predict the major mechanism of this prescription.
RESULTS: The formula contained at least 154 potential active ingredients and a
total of 4,270 unique targets, among which a total of 158 GBS-related disease
targets and 70 common targets were found. The key targets included EGFR
(Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor), ITGAL (Integrin 
Subunit Alpha L), and CEBPA (CCAAT/Enhancer-Binding Protein Alpha), CPT2
(Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 2), CRP (C-reactive protein), ICAM1
(Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1), IL6 (interleukin 6), and PECAM1 (Platelet
and Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule 1), CREBBP (CREB Binding Protein), etc.
The GO enrichment analysis results revealed 116 terms, and the KEGG signaling
pathway enrichment analysis results yielded 61 pathways, including influenza A,
hepatitis B, malaria, etc.
CONCLUSIONS: The development of GBS and the mechanism underlying the effects of
the GBS-experiential prescription have common and complex targets, which are
worthy of in-depth exploration.

BACKGROUND: Fundamental transformations in overall population health have
occurred in the past five decades and are continuing. Our aim in this study was
to characterize the trends in population mortality rates in the United States
(U.S.) from 1969 to 2017.
METHODS: Data on the 109,836,044 deaths registered in the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed by sex, race and
ethnicity, and age. Temporal trends in population mortality rates were examined
from 1969 to 2017. All data analyses were performed using the SEER*Stat software.
RESULTS: The overall mortality rate for males and females in the U.S. per 100,000
population fell by 46.1% and 39.3%, from 1,610.0 and 1,019.3 in 1969 to 867.2 and
619.2 in 2017, respectively. This decline in overall mortality was mainly
attributable to a decrease in mortality caused by heart and cerebrovascular
diseases. From 1969 to 2017, the overall mortality rate was higher in males than 
females, and in blacks than whites for both sexes. From 1979 to 2017, the
mortality rates of heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and diabetes were
all higher in blacks than in whites for both sexes.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the U.S. has dramatically reduced its
overall annual mortality rate between 1969 and 2017; however, the disparities
among different races are still apparent.

Variability in SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and COVID-19 disease severity between
individuals is partly due to genetic factors. Here, we identify 4 genomic loci
with suggestive associations for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and 19 for COVID-19
disease severity. Four of these 23 loci likely have an ethnicity-specific
component. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals in 11 loci colocalize
with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of
20 genes in 62 tissues/cell types (range: 1:43 tissues/gene), including lung,
brain, heart, muscle, and skin as well as the digestive system and immune system.
We perform genetic fine mapping to compute 99% credible SNP sets, which identify 
10 GWAS loci that have eight or fewer SNPs in the credible set, including three
loci with one single likely causal SNP. Our study suggests that the diverse
symptoms and disease severity of COVID-19 observed between individuals is
associated with variants across the genome, affecting gene expression levels in a
wide variety of tissue types.

BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify a novel potential use for web portals in 
health care and health research: their adoption for the purposes of rapidly
sharing health research findings with clinicians, scientists, and patients. In
the era of precision medicine and learning health systems, the translation of
research findings into targeted therapies depends on the availability of big data
and emerging research results. Web portals may work to promote the availability
of novel research, working in tandem with traditional scientific publications and
conference proceedings.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the potential use of web portals, which
facilitate the sharing of health research findings among researchers, clinicians,
patients, and the public. It also summarizes the potential legal, ethical, and
policy implications associated with such tools for public use and in the
management of patient care for complex diseases.
METHODS: This study broadly adopts the methods for scoping literature reviews
outlined by Arskey and O'Malley in 2005. Raised by the integration of web portals
into patient care for complex diseases, we systematically searched 3 databases,
PubMed, Scopus, and WestLaw Next, for sources describing web portals for sharing 
health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients and their
associated legal, ethical, and policy challenges. Of the 719 candidate source
citations, 22 were retained for the review.
RESULTS: We found varied and inconsistent treatment of web portals for sharing
health research findings among clinicians, researchers, and patients. Although
the literature supports the view that portals of this kind are potentially highly
promising, they remain novel and are not yet widely adopted. We also found a wide
range of discussions on the legal, ethical, and policy issues related to the use 
of web portals to share research data.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified 5 important legal and ethical challenges: privacy and 
confidentiality, patient health literacy, equity, training, and decision-making. 
We contend that each of these has meaningful implications for the increased
integration of web portals into clinical care.

OBJECTIVE: To compare differences in academic performance between adolescents who
were randomised in infancy to modified or standard infant formula.
DESIGN: Linkage of seven dormant randomised controlled trials to national
education data.
SETTING: Five hospitals in England, 11 August 1993 to 29 October 2001, and
schools in England, September 2002 to August 2016.
PARTICIPANTS: 1763 adolescents (425 born preterm, 299 born at term and small for 
gestational age, 1039 born at term) who took part in one of seven randomised
controlled trials of infant formula in infancy.
INTERVENTIONS: Nutrient enriched versus standard term formula (two trials), long 
chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) supplemented versus unsupplemented
formula (two trials), high versus low iron follow-on formula (one trial), high
versus low sn-2 palmitate formula (one trial), and nucleotide supplemented versus
unsupplemented formula (one trial).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome, determined by linkage of trial data
to school data, was the mean difference in standard deviation scores for mandated
examinations in mathematics at age 16 years. Secondary outcomes included
differences in standard deviation scores in English (16 and 11 years) and
mathematics (11 years). Analysis was by intention to treat with multiple
imputation for participants missing the primary outcome.
RESULTS: 1607 (91.2%) participants were linked to school records. No benefit was 
found for performance in mathematics examinations at age 16 years for any
modified formula: nutrient enriched in preterm infants after discharge from
hospital, standard deviation score 0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to 0.27), 
and nutrient enriched in small for gestational age term infants -0.11 (-0.33 to
0.12); LCPUFA supplemented in preterm infants -0.19 (-0.46 to 0.08) and in term
infants -0.14 (-0.36 to 0.08); iron follow-on formula in term infants -0.12
(-0.31 to 0.07); and sn-2 palmitate supplemented formula in term infants -0.09
(-0.37 to 0.19). Participants from the nucleotide trial were too young to have
sat their General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations at the
time of linkage to school data. Secondary outcomes did not differ for nutrient
enriched, high iron, sn-2 palmitate, or nucleotide supplemented formulas, but at 
11 years, preterm and term participants randomised to LCPUFA supplemented formula
scored lower in English and mathematics.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from these randomised controlled trials indicated that the 
infant formula modifications did not promote long term cognitive benefit compared
with standard infant formulas.

BACKGROUND: Congenital Heart Defects (CHD) is the most commonly occurring
congenital anomaly in Europe and a major paediatric health care concern.
Investigations are needed to enable identification of CHD risk factors as studies
have given conflicting results. This study aim was to identify maternal
sociodemographic characteristics, behaviours, and birth outcomes as risk factors 
for CHD. This was a population based, data linkage cohort study using anonymised 
data from Northern Ireland (NI) covering the period 2010-2014. The study cohort
composed of 94,067 live births with an outcome of 1162 cases of CHD using the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 
(ICD)-10 codes and based on the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies
(EUROCAT) grouping system for CHD. CHD cases were obtained from the HeartSuite
database (HSD) at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC), maternal 
data were extracted from the Northern Ireland Maternity System (NIMATS), and
medication data were extracted from the Enhanced Prescribing Database (EPD).
STATA version 14 was used for the statistical analysis in this study, Odds Ratio 
(OR), 95% Confident intervals (CI), P value, and logistic regression were used in
the analysis. Ethical approval was granted from the National Health Service (NHS)
Research Ethics Committee.
RESULT: In this study, a number of potential risk factors were assessed for
statistically significant association with CHD, however only certain risk factors
demonstrated a statistically significant association with CHD which included:
gestational age at first booking (AOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04-1.41; P < 0.05),
family history of CHD or congenital abnormalities and syndromes (AOR = 4.14; 95% 
CI = 2.47-6.96; P < 0.05), woman's smoking in pregnancy (AOR = 1.22; 95%
CI = 1.04-1.43; P < 0.05), preterm birth (AOR = 3.01; 95% CI = 2.44-3.01;
P < 0.05), multiple births (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.58-2.60; P < 0.05), history of
abortion (AOR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.03-1.28; P < 0.05), small for gestational age
(SGA) (AOR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.22-1.78; P < 0.05), and low birth weight (LBW)
(AOR = 3.10; 95% CI = 2.22-3.55; P < 0.05). Prescriptions and redemptions of
antidiabetic (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI = 1.85-3.98; P < 0.05), antiepileptic
(AOR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.10-2.81; P < 0.05), and dihydrofolate reductase
inhibitors (DHFRI) (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.17-5.85; P < 0.05) in early pregnancy 
also showed evidence of statistically significant association with CHD.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that there are certain maternal
sociodemographic characteristics, behaviours and birth outcomes that are
statistically significantly associated with higher risk of CHD. Appropriate
prevention policy to target groups with higher risk for CHD may help to reduce
CHD prevalence. These results are important for policy makers, obstetricians,
cardiologists, paediatricians, midwives and the public.

OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a modifiable risk factor for numerous comorbidities
and treating hypertension can greatly improve health outcomes. We sought to
increase the efficiency of a virtual hypertension management program through
workflow automation processes.
METHODS: We developed a customer relationship management (CRM) solution at our
institution for the purpose of improving processes and workflow for a virtual
hypertension management program and describe here the development,
implementation, and initial experience of this CRM system.
RESULTS: Notable system features include task automation, patient data capture,
multi-channel communication, integration with our electronic health record (EHR),
and device integration (for blood pressure cuffs). In the five stages of our
program (intake and eligibility screening, enrollment, device
configuration/setup, medication titration, and maintenance), we describe some of 
the key process improvements and workflow automations that are enabled using our 
CRM platform, like automatic reminders to capture blood pressure data and present
these data to our clinical team when ready for clinical decision making. We also 
describe key limitations of CRM, like balancing out-of-the-box functionality with
development flexibility. Among our first group of referred patients, 76% (39/51) 
preferred email as their communication method, 26/51 (51%) were able to enroll
electronically, and 63% of those enrolled (32/51) were able to transmit blood
pressure data without phone support.
CONCLUSION: A CRM platform could improve clinical processes through multiple
pathways, including workflow automation, multi-channel communication, and device 
integration. Future work will examine the operational improvements of this health
information technology solution as well as assess clinical outcomes.

With the fast development of economics, road safety is becoming a serious
problem. Exploring macro factors is effective to improve road safety. However,
the existing studies have some limitations: (1) The existing studies only
considered one aspect of macro factors and constructed models based on a few data
samples. (2) The methods commonly used cannot address the non-linear relationship
or calculate the feature importance. The findings obtained from such models may
be limited and biased. To address the limitations, this study proposes a
BO-CV-XGBoost framework to explore the macro factors related to traffic fatality 
rate classes based on a high-dimensional dataset that fully considers the impact 
of multi-factor interaction with adequate data samples. The proposed framework is
applied to a dataset in the US. 453 county-level macro factors are collected from
various data sources, covering ten macro aspects, including topography,
transportation, etc. The optimized BO-CV-XGBoost model obtains the best
classification performance with an AUC of 0.8977 and an accuracy of 85.02%.
Compared with other methods, the proposed model has superiority on fatality rate 
classification. Ten macro factors are identified, including 'Current-dollar GDP',
'highway miles per person', etc. The ten factors contain four aspects of
information, including economics, transportation, education, and medical
condition. Geographic information system (GIS) techniques are further used for
spatial analysis of the identified macro factors. Therefore, targeted and
effective measures are accordingly proposed to prevent traffic fatalities and
improve road safety.

There are many proposed classification systems for müllerian anomalies. The
American Fertility Society (AFS) Classification from 1988 has been the most
recognized and utilized. The advantages of this iconic classification include its
simplicity, recognizability, and correlation with clinical pregnancy outcomes.
However, the AFS classification has been criticized for its focus primarily on
uterine anomalies, with exclusion of those of the vagina and cervix, its lack of 
clear diagnostic criteria, and its inability to classify complex aberrations.
Despite this classification and others, the wide range of müllerian anomalies is 
still largely unknown and confusing to many providers. Consequently, müllerian
anomalies may go undiagnosed for extended periods, receive inappropriate or
inadequate surgical interventions, and result in persistent issues such as pain
or loss of reproductive function. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine 
Task Force on Müllerian Anomalies Classification was formed and charged with
designing a new classification. The Task Force set goals for a new classification
and chose to base it on the iconic AFS classification from 1988 because of its
simplicity and recognizability, while expanding and updating it to include all
categories of anomalies. In addition, this was recognized as an opportunity to
raise awareness of this area of medicine, educate providers and learners, and
promote patient advocacy. Presented here is the new American Society for
Reproductive Medicine Müllerian Anomalies Classification 2021.

Under pandemic conditions, it is important to communicate local infection risks
to better enable the general population to adjust their behaviors accordingly. In
Japan, our team operates a popular non-government and not-for-profit dashboard
project - "Japan LIVE Dashboard" - which allows the public to easily grasp the
evolution of the pandemic on the internet. We presented the Dashboard design
concept with a generic framework integrating socio-technical theories, disease
epidemiology and related contexts, and evidence-based approaches. Through
synthesizing multiple types of reliable and real-time local data sources from all
prefectures across the country, the Dashboard allows the public access to
user-friendly and intuitive disease visualization in real time and has gained an 
extensive online followership. To date, it has attracted c.30 million visits (98%
domestic access) testifying to the reputation it has acquired as a user-friendly 
portal for understanding the progression of the pandemic. Designed as an
open-source solution, the Dashboard can also be adopted by other countries as
well as made applicable for other emerging outbreaks in the future. Furthermore, 
the conceptual design framework may prove applicable into other ehealth scaled
for global pandemics.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many global industries and shifted the
digital health landscape by stimulating and accelerating the delivery of digital 
care. It has emphasized the need for a system level informatics implementation
that supports the healthcare management of populations at a macro level while
also providing the necessary support for front line care delivery at a micro
level. From data dashboard to Telemedicine, this crisis has necessitated the need
for health informatics transformation that can bridge time and space to provide
timely care. However, heath transformation cannot solely rely on Health
Information Technology (HIT) for progress, but rather success must be an outcome 
of system design focus on the contextual complexity of the health system where
HIT is used. This conference highlights the important roles context plays for
health informatics in global pandemics and aims to answer critical questions in
four main areas: 1) health information management in the covid-19 context, 2)
implementation of new practices and technologies in healthcare, 3) sociotechnical
analysis of task performance and workload in healthcare, and 4) innovations in
design and evaluation methods of health technologies. We deem this as a call to
action to understand the importance of context while solving the last mile
problem in delivering the informatics solutions that are needed to support our
public health response.

This research was to explore the adoption value of computed tomography (CT)
images based on adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) algorithm in
the evaluation of probiotics combined with ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment 
of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). A total of 82 patients with ICP
were selected as the research subjects and they were randomly rolled into
experimental group (380 mg probiotics enteric-soluble capsule twice a day,
combined with 90 mg ursodeoxycholic acid soft capsule three times a day) and
control group (90 mg ursodeoxycholic acid soft capsule three times a day), with
41 cases in each. The treatment course was four months. The ASIR algorithm was
constructed and applied to the CT image analysis and diagnosis of ICP patients.
The effects of filtering back projection (FBP) reconstruction and ASIR algorithm 
on CT image quality, denoising degree, and artifacts of ICP patients were
compared. Moreover, blood indicator levels of ICP patients before and after
treatment were assessed. The results showed that the SD values of liver and
gallbladder (20.77 Hu and 27.58 Hu) in the reconstructed image of the ASIR
algorithm were significantly lower than those of the FBP algorithm (40.58 Hu and 
45.63 Hu) (P < 0.05). The SNR values of the liver and gallbladder (3.68 and 2.05)
of the reconstructed image were significantly higher than those of the FBP
algorithm (1.91 and 1.19) (P < 0.05). The overall image quality after ASIR
reconstruction (3.92 points) was significantly better than that of the FBP
algorithm (2.36 points), and the image noise score (3.21 points) reconstructed by
the FBP algorithm was higher than that by the ASIR algorithm (1.83 points). The
artifact score of FBP reconstructed image (4.47 points) was greatly higher than
that of ASIR algorithm (2.26 points) (P < 0.05). Before treatment, there was no
remarkable difference in the indexes between the two groups of patients (P >
0.05). After treatment, the γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) levels (327.55 U/L and 778.15 μmol/L) of the experimental group of ICP
patients were higher than those of the control group (248.63 U/L and
668.43 μmol/L), with substantial difference between the two groups (P < 0.05).
The blood ammonia (BA) level (151.09 μmol/L) of the experimental group was lower 
than that of the control group (178.46 μmol/L), and the difference between the
two groups was remarkable (P < 0.05). To sum up, the CT image denoising degree
based on ASIR algorithm was high, with few artifacts and good overall quality.
Probiotics combined with ursodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of ICP can
effectively improve the liver function and intestinal flora of patients, which
was of great significance in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

Deep learning (DL) is a branch of machine learning and artificial intelligence
that has been applied to many areas in different domains such as health care and 
drug design. Cancer prognosis estimates the ultimate fate of a cancer subject and
provides survival estimation of the subjects. An accurate and timely diagnostic
and prognostic decision will greatly benefit cancer subjects. DL has emerged as a
technology of choice due to the availability of high computational resources. The
main components in a standard computer-aided design (CAD) system are
preprocessing, feature recognition, extraction and selection, categorization, and
performance assessment. Reduction of costs associated with sequencing systems
offers a myriad of opportunities for building precise models for cancer diagnosis
and prognosis prediction. In this survey, we provided a summary of current works 
where DL has helped to determine the best models for the cancer diagnosis and
prognosis prediction tasks. DL is a generic model requiring minimal data
manipulations and achieves better results while working with enormous volumes of 
data. Aims are to scrutinize the influence of DL systems using histopathology
images, present a summary of state-of-the-art DL methods, and give directions to 
future researchers to refine the existing methods.

Background: As a chronic disease, osteoarthritis has caused great trouble to the 
health of middle-aged and elderly people. Studies have shown that glucosamine
(GlcN) can be used to abate the progression and improve this disease. Based on
this point of view, we try to verify the connection between GlcN and
osteoarthritis and find more effective biomarkers.
Methods: We downloaded the GSE72575 data set from the GEO database, and used the 
R language to perform DEG analysis on the gene expression profile of the samples.
Next, the GO function and the KEGG signaling pathways were analyzed through the
DAVID database, and then, the KEGG pathways enriched in the gene set were
analyzed based on GSEA. Then, the PPI network of DEGs was constructed based on
the STRING online database, and finally, the hub genes were selected by
Cytoscape.
Results: Three GlcN-treated MH7A cell treatment groups and 3 control groups in
the GSE72575 data set were studied. Through analysis, there were 52 DEGs in these
samples. Then, through GO, KEGG, and GSEA, regulation of endoplasmic reticulum
stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway,
JAK-STAT signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling
pathway, and ECM receptor interaction were involved in the regulatory mechanisms 
of the osteoarthritis pathogenesis. After that, the hub genes IL6 and DDIT3 were 
identified through PPI network construction and analysis. And it was found that
IL6 was lowly expressed in the group with GlcN-treated MH7A cells, while DDIT3
was highly expressed.
Conclusion: The above results provide a basis for GlcN to participate in the
treatment of osteoarthritis and a possibility for finding effective therapeutic
targets.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) are a payment system that could
effectively solve the problem of excessive increases in healthcare costs which
are applied as a principal measure in the healthcare reform in China. However,
expert-oriented DRG grouping is a black box with the drawbacks of upcoding and
high cost.
METHODS: This study proposes a method of data-based grouping, designed and
updated by machine learning algorithms, which could be trained by real cases, or 
even simulated cases. It inherits the decision-making rules from the
expert-oriented grouping and improves performance by incorporating continuous
updates at low cost. Five typical classification algorithms were assessed and
some suggestions were made for algorithm choice. The kappa coefficients were
reported to evaluate the performance of grouping.
RESULTS: Based on tenfold cross-validation, experiments showed that data-based
grouping had a similar classification performance to the expert-oriented grouping
when choosing suitable algorithms. The groupings trained by simulated cases had
less accuracy when they were tested by the real cases rather than simulated
cases, but the kappa coefficients of the best model were still higher than 0.6.
When the grouping was tested in a new DRGs system, the average kappa coefficients
were significantly improved from 0.1534 to 0.6435 by the update; and with enough 
computation resources, the update process could be completed in a very short
time.
CONCLUSIONS: As a new potential option, the data-based grouping meets the
requirements of the DRGs system and has the advantages of high transparency and
low cost in the design and update process.

BACKGROUND: The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has long been the 
main basis for comparability of statistics on causes of mortality and morbidity
between places and over time. This paper provides an overview of the recently
completed 11th revision of the ICD, focusing on the main innovations and their
implications.
MAIN TEXT: Changes in content reflect knowledge and perspectives on diseases and 
their causes that have emerged since ICD-10 was developed about 30 years ago.
Changes in design and structure reflect the arrival of the networked digital era,
for which ICD-11 has been prepared. ICD-11's information framework comprises a
semantic knowledge base (the Foundation), a biomedical ontology linked to the
Foundation and classifications derived from the Foundation. ICD-11 for Mortality 
and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11-MMS) is the primary derived classification and
the main successor to ICD-10. Innovations enabled by the new architecture include
an online coding tool (replacing the index and providing additional functions),
an application program interface to enable remote access to ICD-11 content and
services, enhanced capability to capture and combine clinically relevant
characteristics of cases and integrated support for multiple languages.
CONCLUSIONS: ICD-11 was adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2019.
Transition to implementation is in progress. ICD-11 can be accessed at
icd.who.int.

BACKGROUND: As biomedical knowledge is rapidly evolving, concept enrichment of
biomedical terminologies is an active research area involving automatic
identification of missing or new concepts. Previously, we prototyped a
lexical-based formal concept analysis (FCA) approach in which concepts were
derived by intersecting bags of words, to identify potentially missing concepts
in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Thesaurus. However, this prototype did not
handle concept naming and positioning. In this paper, we introduce a
sequenced-based FCA approach to identify potentially missing concepts, supporting
concept naming and positioning.
METHODS: We consider the concept name sequences as FCA attributes to construct
the formal context. The concept-forming process is performed by computing the
longest common substrings of concept name sequences. After new concepts are
formalized, we further predict their potential positions in the original
hierarchy by identifying their supertypes and subtypes from original concepts.
Automated validation via external terminologies in the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and biomedical literature in PubMed is performed to evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach.
RESULTS: We applied our sequenced-based FCA approach to all the sub-hierarchies
under Disease or Disorder in the NCI Thesaurus (19.08d version) and five
sub-hierarchies under Clinical Finding and Procedure in the SNOMED CT (US
Edition, March 2020 release). In total, 1397 potentially missing concepts were
identified in the NCI Thesaurus and 7223 in the SNOMED CT. For NCI Thesaurus, 85 
potentially missing concepts were found in external terminologies and 315 of the 
remaining 1312 appeared in biomedical literature. For SNOMED CT, 576 were found
in external terminologies and 1159 out of the remaining 6647 were found in
biomedical literature.
CONCLUSION: Our sequence-based FCA approach has shown the promise for identifying
potentially missing concepts in biomedical terminologies.

A previous Informatics Education column argued that, while instruction is a
competency defined by the Medical Library Association and is a job requirement
for many public services librarians, little opportunity exists for learning how
to teach in formal training venues, such as library school, relegating librarians
to learn how to teach on their own. After examining some of the literature
surrounding pedagogy for medical informatics librarians, a link to a brief,
informal survey on pedagogical training needs was provided. This column follows
up with results from that needs assessment.

Neural Network-Oriented Big Data Model for Yoga Movement Recognition.

Wang H(1).

Author information: 
(1)School of Physical Education, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, China.

The use of computer vision for target detection and recognition has been an
interesting and challenging area of research for the past three decades.
Professional athletes and sports enthusiasts in general can be trained with
appropriate systems for corrective training and assistive training. Such a need
has motivated researchers to combine artificial intelligence with the field of
sports to conduct research. In this paper, we propose a Mask Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (MR-CNN)- based method for yoga movement recognition based on the 
image task of yoga movement recognition. The improved MR-CNN model is based on
the framework and structure of the region-convolutional network, which proposes a
certain number of candidate regions for the image by feature extraction and
classifies them, then outputs these regions as detected bounding boxes, and does 
mask prediction for the candidate regions using segmentation branches. The
improved MR-CNN model uses an improved deep residual network as the backbone
network for feature extraction, bilinear interpolation of the extracted candidate
regions using Region of Interest (RoI) Align, followed by target classification
and detection, and segmentation of the image using the segmentation branch. The
model improves the convolution part in the segmentation branch by replacing the
original standard convolution with a depth-separable convolution to improve the
network efficiency. Experimentally constructed polygon-labeled datasets are
simulated using the algorithm. The deepening of the network and the use of
depth-separable network improve the accuracy of detection while maintaining the
reliability of the network and validate the effectiveness of the improved MR-CNN.

Construction and analysis of the protein-protein interaction network for the
detoxification enzymes of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.

Detoxification enzymes are necessary for insects to metabolize toxic substances
and maintain physiological activities. Cytochromes P450 (CYPs), glutathione
S-transferases (GSTs), and carboxylesterase (CarEs) are the main detoxification
enzymes in insects. In addition, UDP-glucosyltransferase and ATP-binding cassette
transporter also participate in the process of material metabolism. This study
collected proteins related to detoxification in the silkworm, Bombyx mori
(Lepidoptera: Bombycidae). And we performed Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis on these proteins to understand
their biological function. We constructed the protein-protein interaction network
for the silkworm's detoxification enzymes and analyzed the network's topological 
properties. We found that BGIBMGA014046-TA, BGIBMGA003221-TA, BGIBMGA011092-TA,
BGIBMGA000074-TA, and LOC732976 are the essential proteins in the network. These 
proteins are primarily involved in the process of ribosome biogenesis and may be 
related to protein synthesis. We integrated GO, KEGG, and network analysis and
found that ribosome-associated protein and GSTs played a vital role in the
detoxification process.

BACKGROUND: Due to the role expansion of radiotherapists in dosimetric aspect,
radiotherapists have taken up organs at risk (OARs) contouring work in many
clinical settings. However, training of newly qualified radiotherapists in OARs
contouring can be time consuming, it may also cause extra burden to experienced
radiotherapists. As web-based open-source radiotherapy delineation software
(WORDS) has become more readily available, it has provided a free and interactive
alternative to conventional one-to-one coaching approach during OARs contouring
training. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of WORDS in
training OARs contouring skills of newly qualified radiotherapists, compared to
those trained by conventional one-to-one coaching approach.
METHODS: Nine newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2017 - 2018) were
enrolled to the conventional one-to-one coaching group (control group), while 11 
newly qualified radiotherapists (licensed in 2019 - 2021) were assigned to WORDS 
training group (measured group). Ten OARs were selected to be contoured in this
3-phases quantitative study. Participants were required to undergo phase 1 OARs
contouring in the beginning of the training session. Afterwards, conventional
one-to-one training or WORDS training session was provided to participants
according to their assigned group. Then the participants did phase 2 and 3 OARs
contouring which were separated 1 week apart. Phase 1 - 3 OARs contouring aimed
to demonstrate participants' pre-training OARs contouring ability, post-training 
OARs contouring ability and knowledge retention after one-week interval
respectively using either training approach. To prevent bias, the computed
tomography dataset for OARs contouring in each phase were different. Variations
in the contouring scores for the selected OARs were evaluated between 3 phases
using Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn tests for pairwise comparisons. Variations
in the contouring scores between control and measured group in phase 1 - 3
contouring were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: In both control group and measured group, significant improvement (p <
0.05) in phase 2 and 3 contouring scores have been observed comparing to phase 1 
contouring scores. In comparison of contouring scores between control group and
measured group, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in all OARs
between both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results in this study have demonstrated that the outcome of OARs
contouring training using WORDS is comparable to the conventional training
approach. In addition, WORDS can offer flexibility to newly qualified
radiotherapists to practice OARs contouring at will, as well as reduce staff
training burden of experienced radiotherapists.

BACKGROUND: Doctors can detect symptoms of diabetic retinopathy (DR) early by
using retinal ophthalmoscopy, and they can improve diagnostic efficiency with the
assistance of deep learning to select treatments and support personnel workflow. 
Conventionally, most deep learning methods for DR diagnosis categorize retinal
ophthalmoscopy images into training and validation data sets according to the
80/20 rule, and they use the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) in
data processing (e.g., rotating, scaling, and translating training images) to
increase the number of training samples. Oversampling training may lead to
overfitting of the training model. Therefore, untrained or unverified images can 
yield erroneous predictions. Although the accuracy of prediction results is
90%-99%, this overfitting of training data may distort training module variables.
RESULTS: This study uses a 2-stage training method to solve the overfitting
problem. In the training phase, to build the model, the Learning module 1 used to
identify the DR and no-DR. The Learning module 2 on SMOTE synthetic datasets to
identify the mild-NPDR, moderate NPDR, severe NPDR and proliferative DR
classification. These two modules also used early stopping and data dividing
methods to reduce overfitting by oversampling. In the test phase, we use the
DIARETDB0, DIARETDB1, eOphtha, MESSIDOR, and DRIVE datasets to evaluate the
performance of the training network. The prediction accuracy achieved to 85.38%, 
84.27%, 85.75%, 86.73%, and 92.5%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experiment, a general deep learning model for detecting
DR was developed, and it could be used with all DR databases. We provided a
simple method of addressing the imbalance of DR databases, and this method can be
used with other medical images.

Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.

BACKGROUND: The increasing proportion of women in medicine has not been
adequately reflected in the gender distribution of radiation oncology residents. 
The presence of at least one pre-residency peer-reviewed publication (PRP) has
been associated with radiation oncology resident choice of academic over private 
practice career, with no significant gender difference in the likelihood of
having a PRP (McClelland et al., 2017). We sought to pursue a gender-based
analysis of PRP productivity in a current junior resident class.
METHODS: A list of radiation oncology residents from the graduating class of 2022
(PGY-2 academic year of 2018-2019) was obtained through internet investigation.
Research productivity was calculated using PRP number, defined as the number of a
resident's publications listed in PubMed (pubmed.gov) through the calendar year
of residency application (2016 for this class).
RESULTS: Of 195 residents examined from the 2022 class, 61 (31%) were women,
representing a nine percent increase from the resident class of 2016. Four-fifths
of women had 1+ PRP, 31% had dual degrees, and 18% had a PhD. These percentages
were comparable to their male counterparts, 73% with 1+ PRP, 28% with dual
degrees, and 15% with a PhD. There were no statistically significant differences 
by gender in any of these benchmarks.
CONCLUSIONS: While slower than the overall trend of increased female
representation in medicine, the proportion of women in radiation oncology
residency has increased by 0.9-1.5% annually over a recent six-year span. There
remain no significant differences in PRP productivity, dual degree status, or PhD
status by gender.

Preparing for the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act:
Incorporating A Sociotechnical Perspective to Enhance a Health Information
Technology Evaluation Framework Applied to Post-Acute Care.

University, Philadelphia, PA.

The Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act, which mandates
electronic sharing of standardized patient data by post-acute care clinical
settings, will likely spur further health information technology adoption and
evaluation. To support evaluation, the study objective was to clarify components 
of an evidence-based health information technology evaluation framework, Health
Information Technology Reference-based Evaluation Framework, by using the
framework in home healthcare and incorporating a sociotechnical perspective in
the health information technology evaluation. With 36 observations among three
diverse home healthcare agencies, researchers conducted a recorded think-aloud
process as nurses documented the home healthcare admission in the EHR. Thematic
analysis revealed 15 themes that provided clarification for almost one-third of
Health Information Technology Reference-based Evaluation Framework components and
added a new concept. All themes reflected a sociotechnical perspective. The new
theme added to the Health Information Technology Reference-based Evaluation
Framework reflected the sociotechnical perspective: routine use. We anticipate
the enhanced Health Information Technology Reference-based Evaluation Framework
to be used by evaluators from diverse disciplines, to further facilitate
context-dependent health information technology adoption in post-acute care
settings.

With the advent of the information age, human demand for information is
increasing day by day. The emergence of the concept of big data has triggered a
new round of technological revolution, and visual information plays an important 
role in information. In order to obtain a better 3D model, this paper studies the
reconstruction model of training motion 3D images based on a graphical neural
network algorithm. This paper studies the problem of Sanda from the following two
aspects. First, we try to apply two deep learning algorithms, graphical neural
network and recurrent neural network, to the boxing movement recognition task and
compare the effects with quadratic discriminant analysis and support vector
machine. By comparing and analyzing the influence of different network structures
on the deep learning algorithm, it is concluded that recurrent neural network has
more practical application advantages than graph neural network in network
structure parameter tuning.

Objectives: The concept of vulnerability has been used more frequently in several
studies, in an attempt to better understand the specificities and needs of
different population groups, both in environmental and socio-economical terms.
The aim of this study is to identify, characterize and analyze populations in
situations of socio-environmental vulnerability in the city of Rio de Janeiro,
based on social, economic, environmental and public health indicators organized
into a summary index - the Socio-Environmental Vulnerability Index. Methods: The 
methodology integrated 15 indicators in a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis into a
Geographic Information System. Results: According to our results,
socio-environmental vulnerability in Rio de Janeiro is aggravated by at-risk
situations and environmental degradation. These aspects are jeopardized by the
population density in slum areas, where the most disadvantaged groups live in a
process of environmental and urban exclusion. Conclusion: The study concludes
about the importance of these tools in guiding resource allocation and their
contribution to formulating and implementing more effective public policies.

BACKGROUND: Welsh onion constitutes an important crop due to its benefits in
traditional medicine. Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plant growth and
yield; however, little is known about its influence on the mechanisms of Welsh
onion regulation genes. In this study, we introduced a gene expression and amino 
acid analysis of Welsh onion treated with different concentrations of nitrogen
(N0, N1, and N2 at 0 kg/ha, 130 kg/ha, and 260 kg/ha, respectively).
RESULTS: Approximately 1,665 genes were differentially regulated with different
concentrations of nitrogen. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the
genes involved in metabolic processes, protein biosynthesis, and transportation
of amino acids were highly represented. KEGG analysis indicated that the pathways
were related to amino acid metabolism, cysteine, beta-alanine, arginine, proline,
and glutathione. Differential gene expression in response to varying nitrogen
concentrations resulted in different amino acid content. A close relationship
between gene expression and the content of amino acids was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: This work examined the effects of nitrogen on gene expression and
amino acid synthesis and provides important evidence on the efficient use of
nitrogen in Welsh onion.

PURPOSE: To increase the superficial dose and reduce the brain dose for
radiotherapy of scalp angiosarcoma, we propose a novel irradiation technique of
tangential irradiation volumetric modulated arc therapy (TI-VMAT).
METHODS: TI-VMAT and the conventional VMAT treatment plans for thirteen scalp
angiosarcoma patients were created with a prescribed dose of 70 Gy. Each
treatment was normalized to cover 95% of the planning target volume (PTV) with
its prescribed dose. To realize TI-VMAT, an avoidance structure (AS) function was
applied. AS was defined as a contour subtracted PTV by a certain space from the
brain contour. TI-VMAT treatment plans for six different spaces between PTV and
AS were developed and compared with the conventional VMAT treatment plan with
respect to the following dosimetric parameters: homogeneity index (HI) and
conformity index (CI) of the PTV, mean brain dose, and brain volume irradiated
with 20% (V20% [cc]), 40% (V40% [cc]), 60% (V60% [cc]), 80% (V80% [cc]), and 100%
(V100% [cc]) of the prescribed dose.
RESULTS: HI and CI were comparable between TI-VMAT and the conventional VMAT, the
mean brain dose for TI-VMAT with AS defined by a space of 2.0 cm and jaw tracking
was 14.27 Gy, which was significantly lower than that for the conventional VMAT
(21.20 Gy). In addition, dosimetric parameters such as V20% [cc] were
significantly suppressed compared to those for high doses.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed irradiation technique TI-VMAT shows the potential to
reduce radiation doses in the brain with maintaining higher dose coverage on the 
PTV.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the last decade, clinical trial management systems 
have become an essential support tool for data management and analysis in
clinical research. However, these clinical tools have design limitations, since
they are currently not able to cover the needs of adaptation to the continuous
changes in the practice of the trials due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature
of the clinical research data. These systems are usually proprietary solutions
provided by vendors for specific tasks. In this work, we propose FIMED, a
software solution for the flexible management of clinical data from multiple
trials, moving towards personalized medicine, which can contribute positively by 
improving clinical researchers quality and ease in clinical trials.
METHODS: This tool allows a dynamic and incremental design of patients' profiles 
in the context of clinical trials, providing a flexible user interface that hides
the complexity of using databases. Clinical researchers will be able to define
personalized data schemas according to their needs and clinical study
specifications. Thus, FIMED allows the incorporation of separate clinical data
analysis from multiple trials.
RESULTS: The efficiency of the software has been demonstrated by a real-world use
case for a clinical assay in Melanoma disease, which has been indeed anonymized
to provide a user demonstration. FIMED currently provides three data analysis and
visualization components, guaranteeing a clinical exploration for gene expression
data: heatmap visualization, clusterheatmap visualization, as well as gene
regulatory network inference and visualization. An instance of this tool is
freely available on the web at https://khaos.uma.es/fimed. It can be accessed
with a demo user account, "researcher", using the password "demo".
CONCLUSION: This paper shows FIMED as a flexible and user-friendly way of
managing multidimensional clinical research data. Hence, without loss of
generality, FIMED is flexible enough to be used in the context of any other
disease where clinical data and assays are involved.

PURPOSE: The unique treatment delivery technique provided by magnetic resonance
guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) can represent a significant drawback when system fail
occurs. This retrospective study proposes and evaluates a pipeline to completely 
automate the workflow necessary to shift a MRgRT treatment to a traditional
radiotherapy linac.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment during the last MRgRT system 
failure were retrospectively included in this study. The core of the proposed
pipeline was based on a tool able to mimic the original MR linac dose
distribution. The so obtained dose distribution (AUTO) has been compared with the
distribution obtained in the conventional radiotherapy linac (MAN). Plan
comparison has been performed in terms of time required to obtain the final dose 
distribution, DVH parameters, dosimetric indices and visual analogue scales
scoring by radiation oncologists.
RESULTS: AUTO plans generation has been obtained within 10 min for all the
considered cases. All AUTO plans were found to be within clinical tolerance,
showing a mean target coverage variation of 1.7% with a maximum value of 4.3% and
a minimum of 0.6% when compared with MAN plans. The highest OARs mean variation
has been found for rectum V60 (6.7%). Dosimetric indices showed no relevant
differences, with smaller gradient measure in favour of AUTO plans. Visual
analogue scales scoring has confirmed comparable plan quality for AUTO plans.
CONCLUSION: The proposed workflow allows a fast and accurate generation of
automatic treatment plans. AUTO plans can be considered equivalent to MAN ones,
with limited clinical impact in the worst-case scenario.

While aromatic cages have extensively been investigated in the context of
structural biology, molecular recognition, and drug discovery, there exist to
date no comprehensive resource for proteins sharing this conserved structural
motif. To this end, we parsed the Protein Data Bank and thus constructed the
Aromatic Cage Database (AroCageDB), a database for investigating the binding
pocket descriptors and ligand binding space of aromatic-cage-containing proteins 
(ACCPs). AroCageDB contains 487 unique ACCPs bound to 890 unique ligands, for a
total of 1636 complexes. This web-accessible database provides a user-friendly
interface for the interactive visualization of ligand-bound ACCP structures, with
a variety of search options that will open up opportunities for structural
analyses and drug discovery campaigns. AroCageDB is freely available at
http://www.pharmbioinf.uni-freiburg.de/arocagedb/.

This study aims to predict the material basis and mechanism of Dachengqi
Decoction in the treatment of sepsis based on network pharmacology. The chemical 
constituents and targets of Dachengqi Decoction were retrieved from TCMSP, UniPot
and DrugBank and the targets for the treatment of sepsis from OMIM and GeneCards.
The potential targets of Dachengqi Decoction for the treatment of sepsis were
screened by OmicShare. STRING database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 were used to construct
the Chinese medicinal-active component-target-disease, active component-key
target-key pathway, and protein-protein interaction(PPT) networks. The gene
ontology(GO) term enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and
genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed by DAVID(P&lt;0.05).
Finally, the animal experiment was conducted to verify some targets and pathways.
A total of 40 active components and 157 targets of the Dachengqi Decoction, 2 407
targets for the treatment of sepsis, and 91 common targets of the prescription
and the disease were also obtained. The key targets were prostaglandin G/H
synthase 2(PTGS2), prostaglandin G/H synthase 1(PTGS1), protein kinase
cAMP-dependent catalytic-α(PRKACA), coagulation factor 2 receptor(F2 R),
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic gamma subunit(PIK3 CG), 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4), etc. A total of 533 terms and 125 pathways were
obtained for the 91 targets. The main terms were the response to drug, negative
regulation of apoptotic process, positive regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic
process and lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway, and the pathways
included pathways in cancer, hepatitis B, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and
protein kinase B(PI3 K/Akt) signaling pathway. The animal experiment confirmed
that Dachengqi Decoction can down-regulate inflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1β(IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α)(P&lt;0.01). It
could also reduce the wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissue, the level of
myeloperoxidase(MPO) and the phosphorylation of PI3 K and Akt(P&lt;0.01). These
results indicated that Dchengqi Decoction could act on inflammation-related
targets and improve sepsis by inhibiting PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway. The animal 
experiment supported the predictions of network pharmacology. Dachengqi Decoction
intervenes sepsis via multiple components, multiple targets, and multiple
pathways. The result lays a foundation for further research on the mechanism of
Dachengqi Decoction in the treatment of sepsis.

Data mining is an important method to obtain the key information from a large
amount of data, and it is widely applied in the research on the modernization of 
traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). The compatibility law of herbs is a key issue 
in the research of TCM prescriptions. This reflects the flexibility and
effectiveness of TCM prescriptions, and it is also a crucial link to the
development of TCM modernization. Therefore, it is the core purpose of the
research on TCM prescriptions to find the compatibility law of herbs and clarify 
the scientific connotation. Data mining, as an effective method and an important 
approach, has formed a standardized system in the research of compatibility law
of herbs, which can reveal the relationship between different Chinese herbs and
summarize the internal rules in compatibility. Two hundred and twenty two
effective papers were sorted out and categorized in this article. The results
showed that data mining was mainly applied in finding the core Chinese herb
pairs, summarizing the utility and attributes of TCM prescriptions, revealing the
relationship between prescriptions, Chinese herbs and syndromes, finding the
optimal dose of Chinese herbs, and producing the new prescriptions. The problems 
of data mining in research of herbs compatibility rules were summarized, and its 
development and trend in current researches were discussed in this article to
provide useful references for the in-depth study of data mining in the
compatibility law of Chinese herbs.

Background: Existing scores to identify children at risk of hospitalized
pneumonia-related mortality lack broad external validation. Our objective was to 
externally validate three such risk scores.
Methods: We applied the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) for
HIV-negative children, the RISC-Malawi, and the Pneumonia Etiology Research for
Child Health (PERCH) scores to hospitalized children in the Pneumonia REsearch
Partnerships to Assess WHO REcommendations (PREPARE) data set. The PREPARE data
set includes pooled data from 41 studies on pediatric pneumonia from across the
world. We calculated test characteristics and the area under the curve (AUC) for 
each of these clinical prediction rules.
Results: The RISC score for HIV-negative children was applied to 3574 children
0-24 months and demonstrated poor discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.66, 95%
confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-0.73) in the identification of children at risk
of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. The RISC-Malawi score had fair
discriminatory value (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.74-0.77) among 17 864 children 2-59 
months. The PERCH score was applied to 732 children 1-59 months and also
demonstrated poor discriminatory value (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.73).
Conclusions: In a large external application of the RISC, RISC-Malawi, and PERCH 
scores, a substantial number of children were misclassified for their risk of
hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. Although pneumonia risk scores have
performed well among the cohorts in which they were derived, their performance
diminished when externally applied. A generalizable risk assessment tool with
higher sensitivity and specificity to identify children at risk of hospitalized
pneumonia-related mortality may be needed. Such a generalizable risk assessment
tool would need context-specific validation prior to implementation in that
setting.

BACKGROUND: Poor data quality is limiting the use of data sourced from routine
health information systems (RHIS), especially in low- and middle-income
countries. An important component of this data quality issue comes from missing
values, where health facilities, for a variety of reasons, fail to report to the 
central system.
METHODS: Using data from the health management information system in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and the advent of COVID-19 pandemic as an
illustrative case study, we implemented seven commonly used imputation methods
and evaluated their performance in terms of minimizing bias in imputed values and
parameter estimates generated through subsequent analytical techniques, namely
segmented regression, which is widely used in interrupted time series studies,
and pre-post-comparisons through paired Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. We also examined
the performance of these imputation methods under different missing mechanisms
and tested their stability to changes in the data.
RESULTS: For regression analyses, there were no substantial differences found in 
the coefficient estimates generated from all methods except mean imputation and
exclusion and interpolation when the data contained less than 20% missing values.
However, as the missing proportion grew, k-NN started to produce biased
estimates. Machine learning algorithms, i.e. missForest and k-NN, were also found
to lack robustness to small changes in the data or consecutive missingness. On
the other hand, multiple imputation methods generated the overall most unbiased
estimates and were the most robust to all changes in data. They also produced
smaller standard errors than single imputations. For pre-post-comparisons, all
methods produced p values less than 0.01, regardless of the amount of missingness
introduced, suggesting low sensitivity of Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to the
imputation method used.
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of multiple imputation in addressing missing
values in RHIS datasets and appropriate handling of data structure to minimize
imputation standard errors. In cases where necessary computing resources are
unavailable for multiple imputation, one may consider seasonal decomposition as
the next best method. Mean imputation and exclusion and interpolation, however,
always produced biased and misleading results in the subsequent analyses, and
thus, their use in the handling of missing values should be discouraged.

BACKGROUND: As COVID-19 continues to spread globally, traditional emergency
management measures are facing many practical limitations. The application of big
data analysis technology provides an opportunity for local governments to conduct
the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management more scientifically. The present
study, based on emergency management lifecycle theory, includes a comprehensive
analysis of the application framework of China's SARS epidemic emergency
management lacked the support of big data technology in 2003. In contrast, this
study first proposes a more agile and efficient application framework, supported 
by big data technology, for the COVID-19 epidemic emergency management and then
analyses the differences between the two frameworks.
METHODS: This study takes Hainan Province, China as its case study by using a
file content analysis and semistructured interviews to systematically comprehend 
the strategy and mechanism of Hainan's application of big data technology in its 
COVID-19 epidemic emergency management.
RESULTS: Hainan Province adopted big data technology during the four stages,
i.e., migration, preparedness, response, and recovery, of its COVID-19 epidemic
emergency management. Hainan Province developed advanced big data management
mechanisms and technologies for practical epidemic emergency management, thereby 
verifying the feasibility and value of the big data technology application
framework we propose.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides empirical evidence for certain aspects of the
theory, mechanism, and technology for local governments in different countries
and regions to apply, in a precise, agile, and evidence-based manner, big data
technology in their formulations of comprehensive COVID-19 epidemic emergency
management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Disease-drug associations provide essential information for drug
discovery and disease treatment. Many disease-drug associations remain unobserved
or unknown, and trials to confirm these associations are time-consuming and
expensive. To better understand and explore these valuable associations, it would
be useful to develop computational methods for predicting unobserved disease-drug
associations. With the advent of various datasets describing diseases and drugs, 
it has become more feasible to build a model describing the potential correlation
between disease and drugs.
RESULTS: In this work, we propose a new prediction method, called LMFDA, which
works in several stages. First, it studies the drug chemical structure, disease
MeSH descriptors, disease-related phenotypic terms, and drug-drug interactions.
On this basis, similarity networks of different sources are constructed to enrich
the representation of drugs and diseases. Based on the fused disease similarity
network and drug similarity network, LMFDA calculated the association score of
each pair of diseases and drugs in the database. This method achieves good
performance on Fdataset and Cdataset, AUROCs were 91.6% and 92.1% respectively,
higher than many of the existing computational models.
CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of LMFDA lies in the introduction of multimodal fusion
using low-rank tensors to fuse multiple similar networks and combine matrix
complement technology to predict potential association. We have demonstrated that
LMFDA can display excellent network integration ability for accurate disease-drug
association inferring and achieve substantial improvement over the advanced
approach. Overall, experimental results on two real-world networks dataset
demonstrate that LMFDA able to delivers an excellent detecting performance.
Results also suggest that perfecting similar networks with as much domain
knowledge as possible is a promising direction for drug repositioning.

SARS-CoV-2 triggered a worldwide pandemic disease, COVID-19, for which an
effective treatment has not yet been settled. Among the most promising targets to
fight this disease is SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), which has been extensively
studied in the last few months. There is an urgency for developing effective
computational protocols that can help us tackle these key viral proteins. Hence, 
we have put together a robust and thorough pipeline of in silico protein-ligand
characterization methods to address one of the biggest biological problems
currently plaguing our world. These methodologies were used to characterize the
interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with an α-ketoamide inhibitor and include details 
on how to upload, visualize, and manage the three-dimensional structure of the
complex and acquire high-quality figures for scientific publications using PyMOL 
(Protocol 1); perform homology modeling with MODELLER (Protocol 2); perform
protein-ligand docking calculations using HADDOCK (Protocol 3); run a virtual
screening protocol of a small compound database of SARS-CoV-2 candidate
inhibitors with AutoDock 4 and AutoDock Vina (Protocol 4); and, finally, sample
the conformational space at the atomic level between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and the
α-ketoamide inhibitor with Molecular Dynamics simulations using GROMACS (Protocol
5). Guidelines for careful data analysis and interpretation are also provided for
each Protocol.

Challenges of health systems in Latin America and the Caribbean include
accessibility, inequity, segmentation, and poverty. These challenges are similar 
in different countries of the region and transcend national borders. The
increasing digital transformation of health care holds promise of more precise
interventions, improved health outcomes, increased efficiency, and ultimately
reduced health-care costs. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the adoption of
digital health tools is in early stages and the quality of cancer registries,
electronic health records, and structured databases are problematic. Cancer
research and innovation in the region are limited due to inadequate academic
resources and translational research is almost fully dependent on public funding.
Regulatory complexity and extended timelines jeopardise the potential improvement
in participation in international studies. Emerging technologies, artificial
intelligence, big data, and cancer research represent an opportunity to address
the health-care challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean collectively, by
optimising national capacities, sharing and comparing best practices, and
transferring scientific and technical capabilities.

The cultivation of watermelons has been a fast growing agriculture industry in
the arid, desert regions of Morocco, relying on groundwater pumping and
transformation of rangelands to farms due to growing demand for the fruit in
national and international markets. This study aims to measure the impact of
watermelon expansion on groundwater resources in the Feija Basin, which is one of
the largest watermelon cultivation areas in Southern Morocco. Field measurements,
statistics, Kriging interpolation, and regression methods were used to measure
the temporal variations in the groundwater level (GL) and salinity between 2013
and 2018 to determine the correlation between different parameters. Remote
sensing data was also used to monitor the watermelon cultivation expansion.
Results show a rapid expansion of agricultural areas from just 185.11 ha in 2007 
to 2560.1 ha in 2018. The groundwater level declined rapidly by about 10 m below 
ground level during the 5 years of the study period. Additionally, the decline
was accompanied by a significant increase in electrical conductivity (salinity)
values over the same time interval from 1077.55 to 1211.9 µS/cm. As a consequence
of the continuous overexploitation and unsustainable management, a lot of wells
have run dry and there have been drinking water shortages in the city of Zagora, 
the closest city nearby. Results can help target efforts to improve the
implementation of conservation strategies to ensure the sustainability of water
use and food production in this region of Morocco.

Ali-M3, an artificial intelligence program, analyzes chest computed tomography
(CT) and detects the likelihood of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on scores
ranging from 0 to 1. However, Ali-M3 has not been externally validated. Our aim
was to evaluate the accuracy of Ali-M3 for detecting COVID-19 and discuss its
clinical value. We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential
Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection
probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11
Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent
chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%)
were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a
COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762‒0.833) and the
goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of
COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and
68.3%, respectively. A cut-off of 0.2 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of
89.2% and 43.2%, respectively. Among the 223 patients who required oxygen, the
AUC was 0.825. Sensitivity at a cut-off of 0.5% and 0.2% was 88.7% and 97.9%,
respectively. Although the sensitivity was lower when the days from symptom onset
were fewer, the sensitivity increased for both cut-off values after 5 days. We
evaluated Ali-M3 using external validation with symptomatic patient data from
Japanese tertiary care facilities. As Ali-M3 showed sufficient sensitivity
performance, despite a lower specificity performance, Ali-M3 could be useful in
excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19.

Conflict of interest statement: At the start of the study, Ali-m3 existed as a
tool produced by Alibaba Damo (Hangzhou) Technology Co., Ltd for research use
that had not received any approval. With the results of this study, we have
confirmed that the Ali-M3 has clinical benefits. Therefore, under a special
expedited review in Japan, Ali-M3 has been approved by the Japanese
Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and licensed for use as a
diagnostic tool in actual practice. For the license in Japan, Ali-m3 should have 
been a commercial tool. Therefore, it was not planned that M3 Inc would benefit
from the commercialization of the Ali-M3 as a result of our research for which M3
provided the Ali-M3 and storage free of charge. The authors have no patents,
products in development, or marketed products associated with this research to
declare. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data
and materials. In Japan, the M3.inc completely held the right of Ali-M3. This
study was utterly free from Alibaba Damo Technology except Alibaba platform by
the right of M3.inc.

Gliomas are common intracranial tumors with high morbidity and mortality in
adults. Transmembrane protein 2 (TMEM2) is involved in the malignant behavior of 
solid tumors. TMEM2 regulates cell adhesion and metastasis as well as
intercellular communication by degrading nonprotein components of the
extracellular matrix. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between TMEM2
expression levels and glioma subtypes or patient prognosis. Our findings revealed
that TMEM2 expression was abnormally upregulated in high-grade glioma. Moreover, 
combining TMEM2, the status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p19q, we
subdivided molecular subtypes with significant differences in survival. Patients 
in the MT-codel-low subgroup had better prognosis than those in the
WT-no-codel-high subgroup, who fared the worst. Additionally, correlation
analysis of TMEM2 and immune cell infiltration indicated an altered tumor
microenvironment (TME) and cell redistribution in the TMEM2 high-expression
subtype. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
analysis revealed that focal adhesion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were
enriched in the TMEM2-expressing group. In conclusion, aberrant TMEM2 expression 
can be used as an independent prognostic marker for refining glioma molecular
subtyping and accurate prognosis. These findings will improve rational decision
making to provide individualized therapy for patients with glioma.

A disulfide bond is an important protein post-translational modification and
plays a key role in regulating protein oxidation status, protein structure, and
stability. Analysis of a disulfide bond using mass spectrometry is challenging
because there lacks an efficient method to separate the disulfide-linked peptides
from a complex protein digest, and the MS data requires sophisticated
interpretation. Here, we developed a novel disulfide bond identification
strategy, termed as "carboxypeptidase Y assisted disulfide-bond identification
(CADI)". CADI is able to significantly reduce sample complexity by depleting ∼90%
of the linear peptides while keeping the disulfide-bonded peptides. Furthermore, 
all CADI data can be directly analyzed by widely used protein database search
engines, such as Mascot and MaxQuant. Our data show that CADI is able to
sensitively identify disulfide bonds in peptides and proteins. However, CADI has 
not yet achieved a satisfied in-depth coverage on complex mammalian cell lysates 
due to the limited enzymatic activity of carboxypeptidase Y and low occurrences
of disulfide bonds in a proteome. Altogether, CADI is a useful method that can
get disulfide-linked peptides enriched and analyzed with regular search engines. 
CADI holds great potentials to deepen the analysis of disulfide bond and other
types of cross-linked peptides on the proteome scale.

Genomic information is key for the implementation of real personalized medicine. 
Nevertheless, access to this kind of information must be controlled because of
its high privacy and security requirements. Several genomic information formats
exist, although we have started from MPEG-G as it includes metadata and
protection mechanisms since its inception and provides a hierarchical structure
to organize the information contained. The proposed GIPAMS modular architecture
provides a secure and controlled access to genomic information, which may help on
improving personalized medicine as described in this paper.

COVID-19's rapid spreads has caused a global pandemic. On 19th February 2020,
Iran reported its first confirmed cases of infections in Qom City and the number 
of diagnosed cases and the death toll rose exponentially in March [1-3]. Managing
the disease, which is considered a pandemic according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) [4], requires definite approaches differing according to
various factors in each country, which may also lead to (in)effective dealing
with the disease. In addition, using international data and information, and WHO 
advice, especially in the crisis and therapeutic procedures, is one of the best
crisis management strategies [5]. For every plan by governances, the first step
is collecting information on epidemic distribution for the purpose of isolating
provinces and cities at a national scale. Thus, Ministry of Health and Medical
Education of Iran (MOHME) attempted to collect the minimum required data on the
infection-affected patients based on medical records and epidemiological factors,
such as demographic data (gender, age and national code), exposure history (close
contact with the infected, suspect patients or even having traveled) and signs
and symptoms (fever, cough, shortness or difficulties in breathing, fatigue,
anorexia, hemoptysis, sputum production, dyspnea, Myalgia, Pharyngalgia, nausea, 
vomiting, Diarrhea, Headache, Abdominal pain, Dizziness, etc.). Therefore, to
ensure accuracy and validity, and to speed up data collection in an area,
Information Technology (IT) tools were required [6]. In this regard, developing
an information system with a simple format and user-friendly interface in the
shortest possible time was the aim. This study presents the local information
system developed in March 2020, which has been registering hospitalized
Covide-19-affected patients in Iranian hospitals up till now. In other words,
this paper introduces features and procedures of one of the national systems as a
health registry that includes clinical information on admitted Covid-19 patients 
in Iranian hospitals from admission to discharge or death. This system is
supported by MOHME, and along with outpatient Point of Care Information Systems
(POCS), feeds the national and international pandemic reports and decisions.

The wide-spread use of Common Data Models and information models in biomedical
informatics encourages assumptions that those models could provide the entirety
of what is needed for knowledge representation purposes. Based on the lack of
computable semantics in frequently used Common Data Models, there appears to be a
gap between knowledge representation requirements and these models. In this
use-case oriented approach, we explore how a system-theoretic,
architecture-centric, ontology-based methodology can help to better understand
this gap. We show how using the Generic Component Model helps to analyze the data
management system in a way that allows accounting for data management procedures 
inside the system and knowledge representation of the real world at the same
time.

Business process modeling aims to construct digital representations of processes 
being executed in the company. However, models derived from the event logs of
their execution tend to overcomplicate the desired representation, making them
difficult to apply. The most accurate recovery of the business process model
requires a comprehensive study of the various artifacts stored in the company's
information system. This paper, however, aims to explore the possibility to
automatically obtain the most accurate model of business process, using mutual
optimization of models recovered from a set of event logs. Further, the obtained 
models are executed in multi-agent simulation model of company, and the resulting
event logs are examined to determine patterns that are specific to distinct
employees and those that generally characterize business process.

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) contain a lot of valuable data about patients,
which is however unstructured. There is a lack of labeled medical text data in
Russian and there are no tools for automatic annotation. We present an
unsupervised approach to medical data annotation. Morphological and syntactical
analyses of initial sentences produce syntactic trees, from which similar
subtrees are then grouped by Word2Vec and labeled using dictionaries and Wikidata
categories. This method can be used to automatically label EMRs in Russian and
proposed methodology can be applied to other languages, which lack resources for 
automatic labeling and domain vocabularies.

pHealth is a data (personal health information) driven approach that use
communication networks and platforms as technical base. Often it' services take
place in distributed multi-stakeholder environment. Typical pHealth services for 
the user are personalized information and recommendations how to manage specific 
health problems and how to behave healthy (prevention). The rapid development of 
micro- and nano-sensor technology and signal processing makes it possible for
pHealth service provider to collect wide spectrum of personal health related
information from vital signs to emotions and health behaviors. This development
raises big privacy and trust challenges especially because in pHealth similarly
to eCommerce and Internet shopping it is commonly expected that the user
automatically trust in service provider and used information systems.
Unfortunately, this is a wrong assumption because in pHealth's digital
environment it almost impossible for the service user to know to whom to trust,
and what the actual level of information privacy is. Therefore, the service user 
needs tools to evaluate privacy and trust of the service provider and information
system used. In this paper, the authors propose a solution for privacy and trust 
as results of their antecedents, and for the use of computational privacy and
trust. To answer the question, which antecedents to use, two literature reviews
are performed and 27 privacy and 58 trust attributes suitable for pHealth are
found. A proposal how to select a subset of antecedents for real life use is also
provided.

Communicating About Mortality in Health Decision Support: 'What and Why and When,
and How and Where and Who'.

The Covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated the need and desire to deal more
openly with mortality, because the effect on survival is central to the
comprehensive assessment of harms and benefits needed to meet a 'reasonable
patient' legal standard. Taking the view that this requirement is best met
through a multi-criterial decision support tool, we offer our preferred answers
to the questions of What should be communicated about mortality in the tool, and 
How, given preferred answers to Who for, Who by, Why, When, and Where. Summary
measures, including unrestricted Life Expectancy and Restricted Mean Survival
Time are found to be reductionist and relative, and not as easy to understand and
communicate as often asserted. Full lifetime absolute survival curves should be
presented, even if they cannot be 'evidence-based' beyond trial follow-up limits,
along with equivalent measures for other criteria in the (necessarily)
multi-criterial decision. A decision support tool should relieve the reasonable
person of the resulting calculation burden.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usability of a top-rated
diabetes app. Such apps are intended to markedly support the achievement of
optimal health and financial outcomes by providing patients with substantive and 
continual support for self-management of their disease between periodic clinician
visits. Poor usability can deter use which is especially concerning in patients
with diabetes due to prevalence of the disease and impact of self-management on
long-term prognosis.
METHODS: A diabetes app was selected due to the prevalence and seriousness of the
disease. A heuristic evaluation was then performed to collect and analyze data on
the usability of the app based on Nielsen's heuristics. Pareto analysis was used 
to illustrate the contribution of each type of heuristic violation, augmented by 
a stacked bar chart illuminating associated severity.
RESULTS: There were 51 heuristic violations on the opening screen, violating 6 of
Nielsen's 10 heuristics. Pareto analysis revealed 29 (57%) of the heuristic
violations involved a match between system and real world and 8 (16%) aesthetic
and minimalist design. Severity ratings ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 (mean: 3.01) with 
80% comprising a major usability problem and 6% a usability catastrophe.
CONCLUSION: Studies show that people with diabetes are more likely to receive
greater benefit from a diabetes app if they are easy to use. The number and
severity of heuristic violations in this study suggest that the commercialization
of mobile health apps may play a factor in bypassing experts in clinical
informatics during the design phase of development. Usability and associated
benefits received from mobile health apps can be enhanced by debugging the user
interface of identified heuristic violations during design. Waiting to correct
ongoing usability issues while apps are in production can result in patients
disengaging from use of digital health tools engendering poorer outcomes.

Technical College, Dongguan, Guangdong 523808, China.

With the diversification and rapid development of society, people's living
conditions, learning and friendship conditions, and employment conditions are
facing increasing pressure, which greatly challenges people's psychological
endurance. Therefore, strengthening the mental health education of students has
become an urgent need of society and a hot issue of common concern. In order to
solve the problems of high misjudgment rate and low work efficiency in the
current mental health intelligence evaluation process, a mental health
intelligence evaluation system based on a joint optimization algorithm is
proposed. The joint optimization algorithm consists of an improved decision tree 
algorithm and an improved ANN algorithm. First, analyze the current research
status of mental health intelligence evaluation, and construct the framework of
mental health intelligence evaluation system; then collect mental health
intelligence evaluation data based on data mining, use joint learning algorithm
to analyze and classify mental health intelligence evaluation data, and obtain
mental health intelligence evaluation results. Finally, through specific
simulation experiments, the feasibility and superiority of the mental health
intelligent evaluation system are analyzed. The results show that the system in
the article overcomes the shortcomings of the existing mental health intelligence
evaluation system, improves the accuracy of mental health intelligence
evaluation, and improves the efficiency of mental health intelligence evaluation.
It has good system stability and can meet the actual current situation, which are
requirements for mental health intelligence evaluation.

AIM: Anastomotic leakage (AL) in left-sided colorectal cancer is a serious
complication, with an incidence rate of 6-18%. We developed a novel predictive
model for AL in colorectal surgery with double-stapling technique (DST)
anastomosis using auto-artificial intelligence (AI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 256 patients who underwent curative surgery for 
left-sided colorectal cancer between 2017 and 2021 were included. In addition to 
conventional clinicopathological factors, we included the type of circular
stapler using DST, conventional double-row circular stapler (DCS) or EEA™
circular stapler with Tri-Staple™ technology, 28 mm Medium/Thick (Covidien, New
Haven, CT, USA) which had triple-row circular stapler (TCS) as a covariate.
Auto-AI software Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc.) was used to
predict AL with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive accuracy was assessed using
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Prediction One also
evaluated the 'importance of variables' (IOV) using a method based on permutation
feature importance.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of the AI model was 0.766. The type of circular
stapler used was the most influential factor contributing to AL (IOV=0.551).
CONCLUSION: This auto-AI predictive model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy
compared to the conventional model. It was suggested that use of a TCS may
contribute to a reduction in the AL rate.

BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate the incidence and grade of radiation pneumonitis
after volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) performed for the treatment of
non-small cell cancer (NSCLC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive non-surgical candidates with NSCLC
underwent VMAT. Thirty-five patients had stage-III tumors and 15 had recurrent
tumors. The prescribed radiation dose for the gross tumor and the elective nodal 
area was 69 Gy in 30 fractions and 51 Gy in 30 fractions, respectively.
RESULTS: Radiation pneumonitis developed in 38 patients (76%, 38/50), and grade
≥2 radiation pneumonitis developed in 11 patients (22%, 11/50). The percentage of
lung volume that received a dose in excess of 5 Gy (V5), V10, V20, V30, and the
mean lung dose (MLD) in the bilateral and ipsilateral lung were significantly
associated with the development of grade ≥2 radiation pneumonitis.
CONCLUSION: The incidence and degree of radiation pneumonitis are acceptable
following treatment of NSCLC with VMAT.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Sarcopenia has been reported to be a significant prognostic
factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years. This study
aimed to clarify the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma treated with reductive hepatectomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 93 patients who underwent
reductive hepatectomy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
RESULTS: Median survival time of the sarcopenia group (16.4 months) was
significantly shorter than that of the non-sarcopenia group (20.4 months). The
overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years of the sarcopenia group were
significantly lower than those of the non-sarcopenia group (57.9%, 8.6%, and 2.9%
vs. 67.3%, 29.2%, and 15.7%, respectively; p=0.035). On multivariate analysis,
sarcopenia was a significant risk factor of overall survival (hazard ratio=1.60, 
95% confidence interval=1.00-2.56, p=0.049).
CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia was a significant prognostic factor of survival after
reductive hepatectomy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

BACKGROUND/AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors of
surgical site infection (SSI) in patients who underwent liver resection for
colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 151 patients who underwent liver resection for
CRLM were included in this study. We investigated the relationship between the
patient characteristics and perioperative factors and the incidence of SSI.
RESULTS: Nineteen (13%) of these patients developed SSI. Multivariate analysis
revealed that modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) (1 or 2, odds ratio 3.86, 
p=0.03) and presence of an enterostomy (yes, odds ratio 3.93, p=0.04) were
significant and independent risk factors for SSI.
CONCLUSION: A higher mGPS and an enterostomy were risk factors for SSI in
patients who underwent a liver resection for CRLM.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Brain metastasis is a rare condition among patients with soft
tissue sarcoma (STS), and its precise incidence remains unclear. The aim of this 
study was to investigate which patients should be screened for brain metastasis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified all patients with STS diagnosed between 2010 
and 2015 in the SEER database. Incidence of brain metastasis at initial
presentation and higher incidence of brain metastasis by histological subtype
were investigated. In addition, risk factors for brain metastasis were examined.
RESULTS: A total of 26,676 patients were included for analysis, of whom 162
patients (0.6%) had brain metastasis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma (6.3%),
malignant hemangioendothelioma (3.1%) and malignant schwannoma (2.6%) showed
higher incidence of brain metastasis. Deep-rooted tumor, trunk tumor, and
histological high-grade tumor tended to show higher incidence of brain
metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Risk factors for brain metastasis were deep location, trunk
development and histologically high-grade tumor, or specific histological
subtypes.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Predictors for complications such as insufficiency of intestinal 
anastomosis in urinary diversion and other risk factors are not well defined. We 
aimed to elucidate predictive factors for complications in urinary diversions
based on preoperative comorbidities and major complications. A special focus was 
set on anastomosis insufficiency as a major complication.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Preoperative comorbidities, postoperative complications,
duration of hospital stay, and follow-up were analyzed in 317 patients with
urinary diversion. The impact of preoperative comorbidities on diversion types
was described and quantified as defined by the age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity 
Index.
RESULTS: Overall, 14.8% of patients showed anastomosis-related complications,
most within the ileal conduit group (15.9% in the cohort). Severe complications
(Clavien-Dindo Classification Score >IIIa) were found in smokers (p=0.046), and
in patients with vascular diseases (p=0.007), a high American Society of
Anaesthesiologists (ASA)-score (p=0.047), a R1- (p=0.009), as well as a pN1
(p=0.007) status.
CONCLUSION: Several independent predictors for several postoperative
complications in urinary diversions were identified, which were independent of
the diversion method.

BACKGROUND/AIM: An update on the incidence, risk factors, clinical sequalae, and 
management of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) following cytoreductive
surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from
the St George CRS/HIPEC database.
RESULTS: Sixty-five (5.7%) out of 1,141 patients developed a POPF. Patients with 
POPFs were older, had a higher peritoneal cancer index, longer operation time,
and required more units of blood intraoperatively. Splenectomy and distal
pancreatectomy were significant risk factors for developing POPFs. While there
was no effect on overall long-term survival in POPF patients, they did suffer
higher rates of Clavien-Dindo grade 3/4 complications, in-hospital deaths, and
longer hospital length of stay. Of the 65 POPF patients, 23 were taken back to
theatre, 48 required radiological drains and 7 underwent endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography.
CONCLUSION: There are multiple risk factors for developing POPFs that are
non-modifiable. While POPFs are associated with increased postoperative
morbidity, long-term survival does not appear to be affected.

BACKGROUND/AIM: While controversial, cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with heated
intra-peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and early postoperative intra-peritoneal
chemotherapy (EPIC) remains the mainstay of treatment for low grade appendiceal
neoplasm with pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). Our study aimed to investigate the
difference in survival when administering HIPEC alone vs. HIPEC + EPIC.
Additionally, we examined whether the duration of EPIC affects survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the difference in survival in 238 patients who 
underwent CRS + HIPEC alone vs. CRS + HIPEC/EPIC combination for low grade
appendiceal cancer. We also compared short course (1-2 days) vs. long course (3-5
days) of EPIC.
RESULTS: HIPEC/EPIC combination group (n=179) showed a significantly better
5-year survival of 95% compared to 71% in HIPEC alone (n=59). There was no
statistically significant difference in 5-year survival between short course
(n=22) and long course of EPIC (n=157).
CONCLUSION: Combined use of HIPEC and EPIC improves 5-year survival in low-grade 
appendiceal neoplasm. Two days of EPIC are sufficient.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the changes in life expectancy and years of life lost in
2020 associated with the covid-19 pandemic.
DESIGN: Time series analysis.
SETTING: 37 upper-middle and high income countries or regions with reliable and
complete mortality data.
PARTICIPANTS: Annual all cause mortality data from the Human Mortality Database
for 2005-20, harmonised and disaggregated by age and sex.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in life expectancy was estimated as the
difference between observed and expected life expectancy in 2020 using the
Lee-Carter model. Excess years of life lost were estimated as the difference
between the observed and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World
Health Organization standard life table.
RESULTS: Reduction in life expectancy in men and women was observed in all the
countries studied except New Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, where there was a gain 
in life expectancy in 2020. No evidence was found of a change in life expectancy 
in Denmark, Iceland, and South Korea. The highest reduction in life expectancy
was observed in Russia (men: -2.33, 95% confidence interval -2.50 to -2.17;
women: -2.14, -2.25 to -2.03), the United States (men: -2.27, -2.39 to -2.15;
women: -1.61, -1.70 to -1.51), Bulgaria (men: -1.96, -2.11 to -1.81; women:
-1.37, -1.74 to -1.01), Lithuania (men: -1.83, -2.07 to -1.59; women: -1.21,
-1.36 to -1.05), Chile (men: -1.64, -1.97 to -1.32; women: -0.88, -1.28 to
-0.50), and Spain (men: -1.35, -1.53 to -1.18; women: -1.13, -1.37 to -0.90).
Years of life lost in 2020 were higher than expected in all countries except
Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea. In the remaining 
31 countries, more than 222 million years of life were lost in 2020, which is
28.1 million (95% confidence interval 26.8m to 29.5m) years of life lost more
than expected (17.3 million (16.8m to 17.8m) in men and 10.8 million (10.4m to
11.3m) in women). The highest excess years of life lost per 100 000 population
were observed in Bulgaria (men: 7260, 95% confidence interval 6820 to 7710;
women: 3730, 2740 to 4730), Russia (men: 7020, 6550 to 7480; women: 4760, 4530 to
4990), Lithuania (men: 5430, 4750 to 6070; women: 2640, 2310 to 2980), the US
(men: 4350, 4170 to 4530; women: 2430, 2320 to 2550), Poland (men: 3830, 3540 to 
4120; women: 1830, 1630 to 2040), and Hungary (men: 2770, 2490 to 3040; women:
1920, 1590 to 2240). The excess years of life lost were relatively low in people 
younger than 65 years, except in Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the US where
the excess years of life lost was >2000 per 100 000.
CONCLUSION: More than 28 million excess years of life were lost in 2020 in 31
countries, with a higher rate in men than women. Excess years of life lost
associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than five times higher
than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015.

BackgroundAlthough many studies reported a close relationship between depression 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying pathophysiological mechanism remains
unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of AD and major
depressive disorder (MDD). Method: The datasets were downloaded from the Gene
Expression Omnibus. After screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs), gene
ontology and pathway analysis were performed and protein-protein interaction,
TF-target gene, and miRNA-target gene networks were established. Results: 171
DEGs of AD-related datasets and 79 DEGs shared by AD and MDD were detected.
Functional analysis revealed that AD and MDD common genes were significantly
enriched in circadian entrainment and long-term depression signaling pathways.
Five hub genes were identified after construction of networks and validation of
hub gene signatures. In conclusion, DYNC1H1, MAPRE3, TTBK2, ITGB1, and WASL may
be potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of AD and MDD.

BACKGROUND: Erectile dysfunction is a disease commonly caused by diabetes
mellitus (DMED) and cavernous nerve injury (CNIED). Bioinformatics analyses
including differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched functions and pathways 
(EFPs), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were carried out in DMED
and CNIED rats in this study. The critical biomarkers that may intervene in
nitric oxide synthase (NOS, predominantly nNOS, ancillary eNOS, and iNOS)-cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme (PDE5) pathway, an
important mechanism in erectile dysfunction treatment, were then explored for
potential clinical applications.
METHODS: GSE2457 and GSE31247 were downloaded. Their DEGs with a |logFC (fold
change)| > 0 were screened out. Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online database was used to analyze the EFPs in Gene
Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes networks based on
down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs respectively. PPI analysis of 2 datasets was
performed in Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING)
and Cytoscape. Interactions with an average score greater than 0.9 were chosen as
the cutoff for statistical significance.
RESULTS: From a total of 1710 DEGs in GSE2457, 772 were down-regulated and 938
were up-regulated, in contrast to the 836 DEGs in GSE31247, from which 508 were
down-regulated and 328 were up-regulated. The 25 common EFPs such as aging and
response to hormone were identified in both models. PPI results showed that the
first 10 hub genes in DMED were all different from those in CNIED.
CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of iNOS with the hub gene complement component 3 in
DMED and the aging process in both DMED and CNIED deserves attention.

BACKGROUND: Global variation in the incidence and outcomes of colorectal cancer
(CRC) is associated with many factors, among which screening policies and early
treatment play substantial roles. However, screening programs and intense
treatment are expensive and require good health care systems. For CRC, no clear
association has yet been established between clinical outcomes and health care
disparities.
METHOD: We used the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) of CRC as a measure of
clinical outcomes for comparison with the Human Development Index (HDI), current 
health expenditure (CHE), and current health expenditure as a percentage of gross
domestic product (CHE/GDP) using linear regression analyses. We included 171
countries based on data from the GLOBOCAN 2018 database.
RESULTS: We found that the regions with the lowest MIRs for CRC are Oceania and
North America. A significant correlation was observed between incidence,
mortality and HDI, CHE, and CHE/GDP among the countries enrolled. Furthermore,
lower MIRs of CRC significantly correlated with higher HDI, CHE, and CHE/GDP
(P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: : CRC MIRs tend to be most favorable in countries with high health
care expenditures and a high HDI.

The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal trend of suicide
mortality in women in the states of Northeastern Brazil. This is an ecological
study of a time series stratified by states in Northeast Brazil from 1996 to
2018, with data extracted from the Mortality Information System (SIM). The
temporal trend was evaluated by negative binomial regression (p values≤0.05).
There was a higher proportion of deaths in black and brown women (73.9%), single 
(57.3%), with the place of death occurring in the home (53.4%). Hanging and
strangulation stood out as the perpetration means (47.6%). Most states showed an 
upward temporal trend, except for Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Sergipe and
Maranhão, which showed a steady trend (p>0.05). An upward temporal trend was
identified in the analysis of deaths by suicide in women in five states in
northeastern Brazil between 1996 and 2018. The information presented can support 
planning and decision-making for the prevention of suicide among women in
northeastern Brazil.

Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia ever created, is a global initiative driven
by volunteer contributions. When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and mobility
restrictions ensued across the globe, it was unclear whether contributions to
Wikipedia would decrease in the face of the pandemic, or whether volunteers would
withstand the added stress and increase their contributions to accommodate the
growing readership uncovered in recent studies. We analyze [Formula: see text]
million edits contributed from 2018 to 2020 across twelve Wikipedia language
editions and find that Wikipedia's global volunteer community responded
resiliently to the pandemic, substantially increasing both productivity and the
number of newcomers who joined the community. For example, contributions to the
English Wikipedia increased by over [Formula: see text] compared to the
expectation derived from pre-pandemic data. Our work sheds light on the response 
of a global volunteer population to the COVID-19 crisis, providing valuable
insights into the behavior of critical online communities under stress.

BACKGROUND: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data
Model (CDM) can be used to transform observational health data to a common
format. CDM transformation allows for analysis across disparate databases for the
generation of new, real-word evidence, which is especially important in rare
disease where data are limited. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive,
life-threatening disease, with rare subgroups such as pulmonary arterial
hypertension (PAH), for which generating real-world evidence is challenging. Our 
objective is to document the process and outcomes of transforming registry data
in PH to the OMOP CDM, and highlight challenges and our potential solutions.
METHODS: Three observational studies were transformed from the Clinical Data
Interchange Standards Consortium study data tabulation model (SDTM) to OMOP CDM
format. OPUS was a prospective, multi-centre registry (2014-2020) and OrPHeUS was
a retrospective, multi-centre chart review (2013-2017); both enrolled patients
newly treated with macitentan in the US. EXPOSURE is a prospective, multi-centre 
cohort study (2017-ongoing) of patients newly treated with selexipag or any
PAH-specific therapy in Europe and Canada. OMOP CDM version 5.3.1 with recent
OMOP CDM vocabulary was used. Imputation rules were defined and applied for
missing dates to avoid exclusion of data. Custom target concepts were introduced 
when existing concepts did not provide sufficient granularity.
RESULTS: Of the 6622 patients in the three registry studies, records were mapped 
for 6457. Custom target concepts were introduced for PAH subgroups (by combining 
SNOMED concepts or creating custom concepts) and World Health Organization
functional class. Per the OMOP CDM convention, records about the absence of an
event, or the lack of information, were not mapped. Excluding these non-event
records, 4% (OPUS), 2% (OrPHeUS) and 1% (EXPOSURE) of records were not mapped.
CONCLUSIONS: SDTM data from three registries were transformed to the OMOP CDM
with limited exclusion of data and deviation from the SDTM database content.
Future researchers can apply our strategy and methods in different disease areas,
with tailoring as necessary. Mapping registry data to the OMOP CDM facilitates
more efficient collaborations between researchers and establishment of federated 
data networks, which is an unmet need in rare diseases.

BACKGROUND: There is huge variability in the way that individuals with tinnitus
respond to interventions. These experiential variations, together with a range of
associated etiologies, contribute to tinnitus being a highly heterogeneous
condition. Despite this heterogeneity, a "one size fits all" approach is taken
when making management recommendations. Although there are various management
approaches, not all are equally effective. Psychological approaches such as
cognitive behavioral therapy have the most evidence base. Managing tinnitus is
challenging due to the significant variations in tinnitus experiences and
treatment successes. Tailored interventions based on individual tinnitus profiles
may improve outcomes. Predictive models of treatment success are, however,
lacking.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use exploratory data mining techniques (ie,
decision tree models) to identify the variables associated with the treatment
success of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for tinnitus.
METHODS: Individuals (N=228) who underwent ICBT in 3 separate clinical trials
were included in this analysis. The primary outcome variable was a reduction of
13 points in tinnitus severity, which was measured by using the Tinnitus
Functional Index following the intervention. The predictor variables included
demographic characteristics, tinnitus and hearing-related variables, and clinical
factors (ie, anxiety, depression, insomnia, hyperacusis, hearing disability,
cognitive function, and life satisfaction). Analyses were undertaken by using
various exploratory machine learning algorithms to identify the most influencing 
variables. In total, 6 decision tree models were implemented, namely the
classification and regression tree (CART), C5.0, GB, XGBoost, AdaBoost algorithm 
and random forest models. The Shapley additive explanations framework was applied
to the two optimal decision tree models to determine relative predictor
importance.
RESULTS: Among the six decision tree models, the CART (accuracy: mean 70.7%, SD
2.4%; sensitivity: mean 74%, SD 5.5%; specificity: mean 64%, SD 3.7%; area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: mean 0.69, SD 0.001) and
gradient boosting (accuracy: mean 71.8%, SD 1.5%; sensitivity: mean 78.3%, SD
2.8%; specificity: 58.7%, SD 4.2%; AUC: mean 0.68, SD 0.02) models were found to 
be the best predictive models. Although the other models had acceptable accuracy 
(range 56.3%-66.7%) and sensitivity (range 68.6%-77.9%), they all had relatively 
weak specificity (range 31.1%-50%) and AUCs (range 0.52-0.62). A higher education
level was the most influencing factor for ICBT outcomes. The CART decision tree
model identified 3 participant groups who had at least an 85% success probability
following the undertaking of ICBT.
CONCLUSIONS: Decision tree models, especially the CART and gradient boosting
models, appeared to be promising in predicting ICBT outcomes. Their predictive
power may be improved by using larger sample sizes and including a wider range of
predictive factors in future studies.

BACKGROUND: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on medical images could 
support physicians in the decision-making process. During the last decades,
researchers have proposed CAD systems in several medical domains achieving
promising results. CAD systems play an important role in digital pathology
supporting pathologists in analyzing biopsy slides by means of standardized and
objective workflows. In the proposed work, we designed and tested a novel CAD
system module based on image processing techniques and machine learning, whose
objective was to classify the condition affecting renal corpuscles (glomeruli)
between sclerotic and non-sclerotic. Such discrimination is useful for the biopsy
slides evaluation performed by pathologists.
RESULTS: We collected 26 digital slides taken from the kidneys of 19 donors with 
Periodic Acid-Schiff staining. Expert pathologists have conducted the slides
preparation, digital acquisition and glomeruli annotations. Before setting the
classifiers, we evaluated several feature extraction techniques from the
annotated regions. Then, a feature reduction procedure followed by a shallow
artificial neural network allowed discriminating between the glomeruli classes.
We evaluated the workflow considering an independent dataset (i.e., processing
images not used in the training procedure). Ten independent runs of the training 
algorithm, and evaluation, allowed achieving MCC and Accuracy of 0.95 (± 0.01)
and 0.99 (standard deviation < 0.00), respectively. We also obtained good
precision (0.9844 ± 0.0111) and recall (0.9310 ± 0.0153).
CONCLUSIONS: Results on the test set confirm that the proposed workflow is
consistent and reliable for the investigated domain, and it can support the
clinical practice of discriminating the two classes of glomeruli. Analyses on
misclassifications show that the involved images are usually affected by staining
artefacts or present partial sections due to slice preparation and staining
processes. In clinical practice, however, pathologists discard images showing
such artefacts.

We present a protein database search engine for the automatic identification of
peptide and protein sequences using the recently introduced method of
two-dimensional partial covariance mass spectrometry (2D-PC-MS). Because the
2D-PC-MS measurement reveals correlations between fragments stemming from the
same or consecutive decomposition processes, the first-of-its-kind 2D-PC-MS
search engine is based entirely on the direct matching of the pairs of
theoretical and the experimentally detected correlating fragments, rather than of
individual fragment signals or their series. We demonstrate that the high
structural specificity afforded by 2D-PC-MS fragment correlations enables our
search engine to reliably identify the correct peptide sequence, even from a
spectrum with a large proportion of contaminant signals. While for peptides, the 
2D-PC-MS correlation-matching procedure is based on complementary and internal
ion correlations, the identification of intact proteins is entirely based on the 
ability of 2D-PC-MS to spatially separate and resolve the experimental
correlations between complementary fragment ions.

In forensic science, the information that teeth provide to the age estimation
process is very important. In adults, one of the most widely used indicators of
skeletal age is the Root Dentin Translucency (RDT), mainly through the Lamendin
technique, which is used in various Latin American contexts. Recently, Parra et
al. (2020) have developed a Bayesian regression model using the Lamendin
technique to establish standardized criteria for estimating age-at-death in
adults in various forensic contexts. In this study, we evaluate the applicability
of this proposal together with the proposal by Lamendin et al. (1992) and Prince 
and Ubelaker (2002) in Latin American contexts. A sample of single-rooted teeth
belonging to 805 individuals from six Latin American countries was used. The
results of the three proposals considered were analyzed taking into account
factors such as age, sex, origin, and the tooth surface on which the variables
were surveyed. Of the factors that would affect the estimates, it was found that 
the age of the individuals had the greatest influence. However, it was confirmed 
that the sex and surface of the teeth on which the measurements were taken did
not influence the final result. On the other hand, as we expected, the
application of the analyzed proposals would also be possible in other forensic
contexts, as shown by the results obtained according to the origin. This research
expands the FIDB with more information on Latino contexts.

The objective of this study was to perform segmentation and extraction of CT
images of pulmonary nodules based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The
Mask-RCNN algorithm model is a typical end-to-end image segmentation model, which
uses the R-FCN structure for nodule detection. The effect of applying the two
algorithm models to the computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of pulmonary nodules
was analyzed, and different indexes of pulmonary nodule CT images in lung
function examination after algorithm optimization were compared. A total of 56
patients diagnosed with pulmonary nodules by surgery or puncture were taken as
the research objects. Based on the Mask-RCNN algorithm, a model for CT image
segmentation processing of pulmonary nodules was proposed. Subsequently, the 3D
Faster-RCNN model was used to label the nodules in the pulmonary nodules. The
experimental results showed that the trained Mask-RCNN algorithm model can
effectively complete the segmentation task of lung CT images, but there was a
little jitter at the boundary. The speed of R-FCN algorithm for nodular detection
was 0.172 seconds/picture, and the accuracy was 88.9%. CT scans were performed on
the 56 patients based on a deep learning algorithm. The results showed that 30
cases of malignant pulmonary nodules were confirmed, and the diagnostic accuracy 
was 93.75%. There were 22 benign lesions, the diagnostic accuracy was 91.67%, and
the overall diagnostic accuracy was 92.85%. This study effectively improved the
diagnostic efficiency of CT images of pulmonary nodules, and the accuracy of CT
images in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules was analyzed and evaluated. It
provided theoretical support for the follow-up diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and
the treatment of lung cancer. It also significantly improved the diagnostic
effect and detection efficiency of pulmonary nodules.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 pandemic, its
dangers, and its rapid spread throughout the world. In March 2021, the second
wave of the pandemic began with a new strain of COVID-19, which was more
dangerous for some countries, including India, recording 400,000 new cases daily 
and more than 4,000 deaths per day. This pandemic has overloaded the medical
sector, especially radiology. Deep-learning techniques have been used to reduce
the burden on hospitals and assist physicians for accurate diagnoses. In our
study, two models of deep learning, ResNet-50 and AlexNet, were introduced to
diagnose X-ray datasets collected from many sources. Each network diagnosed a
multiclass (four classes) and a two-class dataset. The images were processed to
remove noise, and a data augmentation technique was applied to the minority
classes to create a balance between the classes. The features extracted by
convolutional neural network (CNN) models were combined with traditional
Gray-level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithms
in a 1-D vector of each image, which produced more representative features for
each disease. Network parameters were tuned for optimum performance. The
ResNet-50 network reached accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the 
Curve (AUC) of 95%, 94.5%, 98%, and 97.10%, respectively, with the multiclasses
(COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal), while it reached accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 99%, 98%, 98%, and 97.51%, respectively,
with the binary classes (COVID-19 and normal).

Advances in science and technology have allowed for incredible improvements in
healthcare. Additionally, the digital revolution in healthcare provides new ways 
of collecting and storing large volumes of patient data, referred to as big
healthcare data. As a result, healthcare providers are now able to use data to
gain a deeper understanding of how to treat an individual in what is referred to 
as personalized healthcare. Regardless, there are several ethical challenges
associated with big healthcare data that affect how personalized healthcare is
delivered. To highlight these issues, this article will review the role of big
data in personalized healthcare while also discussing the ethical challenges
associated with it. The article will also discuss public health surveillance, its
implications, and the challenges associated with collecting participants'
information. The article will proceed by highlighting next generation
technologies, including robotics and 3D printing. The article will conclude by
providing recommendations on how patient privacy can be protected in
next-generation personalized healthcare.

Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for contact suppression have been widely
used worldwide, which impose harmful burdens on the well-being of populations and
the local economy. The evaluation of alternative NPIs is needed to confront the
pandemic with less disruption. By harnessing human mobility data, we develop an
agent-based model that can evaluate the efficacies of NPIs with individualized
mobility simulations. Based on the model, we propose data-driven targeted
interventions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong without city-wide
NPIs. We develop a data-driven agent-based model for 7.55×106 Hong Kong residents
to evaluate the efficacies of various NPIs in the first 80 days of the initial
outbreak. The entire territory of Hong Kong has been split into 4905 500×500m2
grids. The model can simulate detailed agent interactions based on the
demographics data, public facilities and functional buildings, transportation
systems, and travel patterns. The general daily human mobility patterns are
adopted from Google's Community Mobility Report. The scenario without any NPIs is
set as the baseline. By simulating the epidemic progression and human movement at
the individual level, we propose model-driven targeted interventions which focus 
on the surgical testing and quarantine of only a small portion of regions instead
of enforcing NPIs in the whole city. The effectiveness of common NPIs and the
proposed targeted interventions are evaluated by 100 extensive simulations. The
proposed model can inform targeted interventions, which are able to effectively
contain the COVID-19 outbreak with much lower disruption of the city. It
represents a promising approach to sustainable NPIs to help us revive the economy
of the city and the world.

AIM: This study aims to evaluate the publications on delirium by using
bibliometric analysis.
METHODOLOGY: The Scopus database was evaluated for publications on delirium,
during the period of 2001-20. The search results were analyzed for the origin of 
country, origin of institution, authorship, collaborations, type of article,
source of funding, and number of citations.
RESULTS: The searches of Scopus database yielded 22,941 publications, originating
from 139 countries. Compared to the decade of 2001-2010, the number of
publications on delirium doubled in the decade of 2011-2020. The majority of the 
papers were research articles (58.26%), and the papers were cited for mean number
of 20.53 times. Only a small proportion of the papers were based on funding
(13.14%). Maximum number of papers emerged from United States of America. In
terms of institutional affiliations, among the authors from top 20 institutes, 15
were from United States, 2 from Netherlands and 1 each from Canada, Germany and
United Kingdom. In terms of authors, the research productivity of the top 20 most
productive authors varied from 172 to 612 publications with 12 authors belonging 
to United States, 2 from Italy and 1 each from Canada, Greece, India, Ireland,
Netherland and the United Kingdom. The maximum number of papers were published in
Journal of the American Geriatric Society and based on the number of citations
the New England Journal of Medicine was the most impactful journal.
CONCLUSION: Over the years number of publications on delirium have increased,
majority of the publications have emerged from United States.

BACKGROUND: There is still no approved mechanism of manic switch in bipolar
disorder, yet many selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were accused for this 
important adverse event. Therefore, we aimed to investigate to estimate SSRI's
risk for reporting mania and elevated mood using FEARS database and investigate
receptor mechanisms involved.
METHODS: Mania and relevant side effects approved by FDA were screened in this
dataset from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2020.
Disproportionality analysis were performed to estimate reporting odds ratio (ROR)
and linear regressions were conducted to investigate relationship between ROR and
Ki values. Receptor occupancy ratios were calculated from in vitro receptor
binding profiles. The pharmacodynamical profile was extracted from the
International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and the British
Pharmacology Society dataset. Child and adolescent population was also
investigated separately.
RESULTS: The analysis showed that the odds of a spontaneous report of mania in
the FAERS database involving an SSRI were higher than the odds that such a report
involved other types of drugs (ROR: 5.324 [CI: 3.773; 7.514]). The largest effect
size in this estimation was found in fluvoxamine (ROR: 13.957 [CI: 10.391;
18.747]). Significant effects were found in regression analysis for Ki values of 
H1 and M1 receptors on ROR. Receptor occupation was not found to have an effect
on ROR.
CONCLUSION: Lower degress of Ki values on M1 and H1 may be plausible
pharmacological mechanism. Further pharmacological data and clinical assessments 
may be important to validate this safety signal.

BACKGROUND: Given the health and economic burden of fractures related to
osteoporosis, suboptimal adherence to medication and the increasing importance of
shared-decision making, the Improvement of osteoporosis Care Organized by Nurses 
(ICON) study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and
feasibility of a multi-component adherence intervention (MCAI) for patients with 
an indication for treatment with anti-osteoporosis medication, following
assessment at the Fracture Liaison Service after a recent fracture. The MCAI
involves two consultations at the FLS. During the first consultation, a decision 
aid is will be used to involve patients in the decision of whether to start
anti-osteoporosis medication. During the follow-up visit, the nurse inquires
about, and stimulates, medication adherence using motivational interviewing
techniques.
METHODS: A quasi-experimental trial to evaluate the (cost-) effectiveness and
feasibility of an MCAI, consisting of a decision aid (DA) at the first visit,
combined with nurse-led adherence support using motivational interviewing during 
the follow-up visit, in comparison with care as usual, in improving adherence to 
oral anti-osteoporosis medication for patients with a recent fracture two Dutch
FLS. Medication persistence, defined as the proportion of patients who are
persistent at one year assuming a refill gap < 30 days, is the primary outcome.
Medication adherence, decision quality, subsequent fractures and mortality are
the secondary outcomes. A lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis using a
model-based economic evaluation and a process evaluation will also be conducted. 
A sample size of 248 patients is required to show an improvement in the primary
outcome with 20%. Study follow-up is at 12 months, with measurements at baseline,
after four months, and at 12 months.
DISCUSSION: We expect that the ICON-study will show that the MCAI is a
(cost-)effective intervention for improving persistence with anti-osteoporosis
medication and that it is feasible for implementation at the FLS.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Netherlands Trial
Registry, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (Trial NL7236 (NTR7435)). Version

PURPOSE: Highly conformal scanned Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT) might permit
dose escalation and improved local control in advanced stage thoracic tumors, but
is challenged by target motion. Dose calculation algorithms typically assume a
periodically repeating, regular motion. To assess the effect of realistic,
irregular motion, new algorithms of validated accuracy are needed.
METHODS: We extended an in-house treatment planning system to calculate
RBE-weighted dose distributions in CIRT on non-periodic CT image sequences.
Dosimetric accuracy was validated experimentally on a moving, time-resolved
ionization chamber array. Log-file based dose reconstructions were compared by
gamma analysis and correlation to measurements at every intermediate detector
frame during delivery. The impact of irregular motion on treatment quality was
simulated on a virtual 4DCT thorax phantom. Periodic motion was compared to
motion with varying amplitude and period ± baseline drift. Rescanning as a
mitigation strategy was assessed on all scenarios.
RESULTS: In experimental validation, average gamma pass rates were 99.89+-0.30%
for 3%/3 mm and 88.2+-2.2% for 2%/2 mm criteria. Average correlation for integral
dose distributions was 0.990±0.002. Median correlation for single 200 ms frames
was 0.947±0.006. In the simulations, irregular motion deteriorated V95 target
coverage to 81.2%, 76.6% and 79.0% for regular, irregular motion and irregular
motion with base-line drift, respectively. Rescanning restored V95 to >98% for
both scenarios without baseline drift, but not with additional baseline drift at 
83.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: The validated algorithm permits to study the effects of irregular
motion and to develop and adapt appropriate motion mitigation techniques.

The annual assessment of Family Planning (FP) indicators, such as the modern
contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), is a key component of monitoring and
evaluating goals of global FP programs and initiatives. To that end, the Family
Planning Estimation Model (FPEM) was developed with the aim of producing
survey-informed estimates and projections of mCPR and other key FP indictors over
time. With large-scale surveys being carried out on average every 3-5 years, data
gaps since the most recent survey often exceed one year. As a result,
survey-based estimates for the current year from FPEM are often based on
projections that carry a larger uncertainty than data informed estimates. In
order to bridge recent data gaps we consider the use of a measure, termed
Estimated Modern Use (EMU), which has been derived from routinely collected
family planning service statistics. However, EMU data come with known
limitations, namely measurement errors which result in biases and additional
variation with respect to survey-based estimates of mCPR. Here we present a data 
model for the incorporation of EMU data into FPEM, which accounts for these
limitations. Based on known biases, we assume that only changes in EMU can inform
FPEM estimates, while also taking inherent variation into account. The addition
of this EMU data model to FPEM allows us to provide a secondary data source for
informing and reducing uncertainty in current estimates of mCPR. We present model
validations using a survey-only model as a baseline comparison and we illustrate 
the impact of including the EMU data model in FPEM. Results show that the
inclusion of EMU data can change point-estimates of mCPR by up to 6.7 percentage 
points compared to using surveys only. Observed reductions in uncertainty were
modest, with the width of uncertainty intervals being reduced by up to 2.7
percentage points.

Importance: There has been limited research on patients with ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI) and COVID-19.
Objective: To compare characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of patients with
STEMI with vs without COVID-19 infection.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive
adult patients admitted between January 2019 and December 2020 (end of follow-up 
in January 2021) with out-of-hospital or in-hospital STEMI at 509 US centers in
the Vizient Clinical Database (N = 80 449).
Exposures: Active COVID-19 infection present during the same encounter.
Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.
Patients were propensity matched on the likelihood of COVID-19 diagnosis. In the 
main analysis, patients with COVID-19 were compared with those without COVID-19
during the previous calendar year.
Results: The out-of-hospital STEMI group included 76 434 patients (551 with
COVID-19 vs 2755 without COVID-19 after matching) from 370 centers (64.1% aged
51-74 years; 70.3% men). The in-hospital STEMI group included 4015 patients (252 
with COVID-19 vs 756 without COVID-19 after matching) from 353 centers (58.3%
aged 51-74 years; 60.7% men). In patients with out-of-hospital STEMI, there was
no significant difference in the likelihood of undergoing primary percutaneous
coronary intervention by COVID-19 status; patients with in-hospital STEMI and
COVID-19 were significantly less likely to undergo invasive diagnostic or
therapeutic coronary procedures than those without COVID-19. Among patients with 
out-of-hospital STEMI and COVID-19 vs out-of-hospital STEMI without COVID-19, the
rates of in-hospital mortality were 15.2% vs 11.2% (absolute difference, 4.1%
[95% CI, 1.1%-7.0%]; P = .007). Among patients with in-hospital STEMI and
COVID-19 vs in-hospital STEMI without COVID-19, the rates of in-hospital
mortality were 78.5% vs 46.1% (absolute difference, 32.4% [95% CI, 29.0%-35.9%]; 
P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with out-of-hospital or in-hospital
STEMI, a concomitant diagnosis of COVID-19 was significantly associated with
higher rates of in-hospital mortality compared with patients without a diagnosis 
of COVID-19 from the past year. Further research is required to understand the
potential mechanisms underlying this association.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs, such as those created by an
anesthesia management system) generate a large amount of data that can notably be
reused for clinical audits and scientific research. The sharing of these data and
tools is generally affected by the lack of system interoperability. To overcome
these issues, Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)
developed the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model
(CDM) to standardize EHR data and promote large-scale observational and
longitudinal research. Anesthesia data have not previously been mapped into the
OMOP CDM.
OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to transform anesthesia data into the OMOP
CDM. The secondary objective was to provide vocabularies, queries, and dashboards
that might promote the exploitation and sharing of anesthesia data through the
CDM.
METHODS: Using our local anesthesia data warehouse, a group of 5 experts from 5
different medical centers identified local concepts related to anesthesia. The
concepts were then matched with standard concepts in the OHDSI vocabularies. We
performed structural mapping between the design of our local anesthesia data
warehouse and the OMOP CDM tables and fields. To validate the implementation of
anesthesia data into the OMOP CDM, we developed a set of queries and dashboards.
RESULTS: We identified 522 concepts related to anesthesia care. They were
classified as demographics, units, measurements, operating room steps, drugs,
periods of interest, and features. After semantic mapping, 353 (67.7%) of these
anesthesia concepts were mapped to OHDSI concepts. Further, 169 (32.3%) concepts 
related to periods and features were added to the OHDSI vocabularies. Then, 8
OMOP CDM tables were implemented with anesthesia data and 2 new tables (EPISODE
and FEATURE) were added to store secondarily computed data. We integrated data
from 5,72,609 operations and provided the code for a set of 8 queries and 4
dashboards related to anesthesia care.
CONCLUSIONS: Generic data concerning demographics, drugs, units, measurements,
and operating room steps were already available in OHDSI vocabularies. However,
most of the intraoperative concepts (the duration of specific steps, an episode
of hypotension, etc) were not present in OHDSI vocabularies. The OMOP mapping
provided here enables anesthesia data reuse.

BACKGROUND: Named entity recognition (NER) plays an important role in extracting 
the features of descriptions such as the name and location of a disease for
mining free-text radiology reports. However, the performance of existing NER
tools is limited because the number of entities that can be extracted depends on 
the dictionary lookup. In particular, the recognition of compound terms is very
complicated because of the variety of patterns.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate an NER tool concerned
with compound terms using RadLex for mining free-text radiology reports.
METHODS: We leveraged the clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System 
(cTAKES) to develop customized pipelines using both RadLex and SentiWordNet (a
general purpose dictionary). We manually annotated 400 radiology reports for
compound terms in noun phrases and used them as the gold standard for performance
evaluation (precision, recall, and F-measure). In addition, we created a compound
terms-enhanced dictionary (CtED) by analyzing false negatives and false positives
and applied it to another 100 radiology reports for validation. We also evaluated
the stem terms of compound terms by defining two measures: occurrence ratio (OR) 
and matching ratio (MR).
RESULTS: The F-measure of cTAKES+RadLex+general purpose dictionary was 30.9%
(precision 73.3% and recall 19.6%) and that of the combined CtED was 63.1%
(precision 82.8% and recall 51%). The OR indicated that the stem terms of
effusion, node, tube, and disease were used frequently, but it still lacks
capturing compound terms. The MR showed that 71.85% (9411/13,098) of the stem
terms matched with that of the ontologies, and RadLex improved approximately 22% 
of the MR from the cTAKES default dictionary. The OR and MR revealed that the
characteristics of stem terms would have the potential to help generate
synonymous phrases using the ontologies.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a RadLex-based customized pipeline for parsing
radiology reports and demonstrated that CtED and stem term analysis has the
potential to improve dictionary-based NER performance with regard to expanding
vocabularies.

ABSTRACT: Our study aimed to investigate the relative workload that is related to
the injury in lower extremities of female field hockey players and to identify
the optimal ratio of acute to chronic workloads (ACWR) depending on the playing
position to manage low risk of sports-related injuries.Data were collected using 
a global positioning systems unit on a full-time basis and during competition
among 52 players who were enrolled in Korea National Team. The ACWR was
calculated by dividing the most recent 1 week workload by the prior 4 weeks
workload. Injury risk was calculated for each category from very low to very high
based on a z-score.In striker and midfielder, the injury risk was the lowest in
the moderate-low category of total distance covered, meters per minute (MpM),
repeated high-intensity effort bouts, and acceleration bouts, and the
moderate-high category of high-intensity running distance (HID). The injury risk 
of a defender was the lowest in the moderate-low category of HID and MpM.The ACWR
in total distance covered, MpM, repeated high-intensity effort bouts, and
acceleration bouts should stay within the moderate-low category in striker and
midfielder positions and HID and MpM in defender positions in order to manage
low-risk of non-contact and soft tissue injuries in female field hockey players.

RATIONALE: Mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (MNSGCTs) are rare
malignancies. Chemotherapy followed by surgical resection has been regarded as
the standard management, but treatment options for chemotherapy-refractory
patients or those with unresectable tumors are limited, resulting in a very poor 
prognosis.
PATIENT CONCERNS: An 18-year-old female presented with symptoms of cough, chest
tightness, and shortness of breath for 2 months, and the symptoms gradually
worsened.
DIAGNOSIS: Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mediastinal mass invading
the pericardium and great blood vessels. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)
and α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were normal. Histopathological examination of
biopsy specimens revealed mixed MNSGCT with embryonal carcinoma and immature
teratoma components.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient achieved complete remission (CR) and long-term
survival after multimodal therapy comprising chemotherapy, positron emission
tomography/CT (PET/CT)-guided volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and
anti-angiogenic targeted therapy.
OUTCOMES: The patient was followed up for more than 4 years without recurrence,
metastasis, or treatment-related adverse effects.
LESSONS: The case presented here highlights the importance of multidisciplinary
diagnosis and treatment, providing evidence that radiotherapy and anti-angiogenic
therapy may play an important role in unresectable or residual tumors after
failure of conventional treatments of MNSGCT. Percutaneous biopsy is necessary
for diagnosis if the tumor is unresectable, and serum AFP and HCG levels are
normal. Additionally, PET/CT is an effective method for evaluation of efficacy
and radiotherapy guidance for patients with MNSGCTs.

This paper analyzed literatures on the specificity study of electroencephalogram 
(EEG) in the diagnosis of depression since 2010 to 2020, summarized the recent
research directions in this field and prospected the future research hotspots at 
home and abroad. Based on databases of China National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI) and the core collection of Web of Science (WOS), CiteSpace software was
used to analyze the relevant literatures in this research field. The number of
relevant literatures, countries, authors, research institutions, key words, cited
literatures and periodicals related to this research were analyzed, respectively,
to explore research hotspots and development trends in this field. A total of 2
155 articles were included in the WOS database. The most published institution
was the University of Toronto, the most published country was the United States, 
China occupied the third place, and the hot keywords were anxiety, disorder,
brain and so on. A total of 529 literatures were included and analyzed in CNKI
database. The institution with the most publications was the Mental Health Center
of West China Hospital of Sichuan University, and the hot keywords were EEG
signal, event-related potential, convolutional neural network, schizophrenia, etc
. This study finds that EEG study of depression is developing rapidly at home and
abroad. Research directions in the world mainly focus on exploring the
characteristics of spontaneous EEG rhythm and nonlinear dynamic parameters during
sleep in depressed patients. In addition, synchronous transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) and EEG technologies also attract much attention abroad, and
the future research hotspot will be on the mechanism of EEG on patients with
major depression. Domestic research directions mainly focus on the classification
of resting EEG and the control study of resting EEG power spectrum entropy in
patients with schizophrenia and depression, and future research hotspot is the
basic and clinical EEG study of depressed patients complicated with anxiety.

Online inquiry platforms, which is where a person can anonymously ask questions, 
have become an important information source for those who are concerned about
social stigma and discrimination that follow mental disorders. Therefore,
examining what people inquire about regarding mental disorders would be useful
when designing educational programs for communities. The present study aimed to
examine the contents of the queries regarding mental disorders that were posted
on online inquiry platforms. A total of 4,714 relevant queries from the two major
online inquiry platforms were collected. We computed word frequencies,
centralities, and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. The words
like symptom, hospital and treatment ranked as the most frequently used words,
and the word my appeared to have the highest centrality. LDA identified four
latent topics: (1) the understanding of general symptoms, (2) a disability
grading system and welfare entitlement, (3) stressful life events, and (4) social
adaptation with mental disorders. People are interested in practical information 
concerning mental disorders, such as social benefits, social adaptation, more
general information about the symptoms and the treatments. Our findings suggest
that instructions encompassing different scopes of information are needed when
developing educational programs.

The internet of reality or augmented reality has been considered a breakthrough
and an outstanding critical mutation with an emphasis on data mining leading to
dismantling of some of its assumptions among several of its stakeholders. In this
work, we study the pillars of these technologies connected to web usage as the
Internet of things (IoT) system's healthcare infrastructure. We used several data
mining techniques to evaluate the online advertisement data set, which can be
categorized as high dimensional with 1,553 attributes, and the imbalanced data
set, which automatically simulates an IoT discrimination problem. The proposed
methodology applies Fischer linear discrimination analysis (FLDA) and quadratic
discrimination analysis (QDA) within random projection (RP) filters to compare
our runtime and accuracy with support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor
(KNN), and Multilayer perceptron (MLP) in IoT-based systems. Finally, the impact 
on number of projections was practically experimented, and the sensitivity of
both FLDA and QDA with regard to precision and runtime was found to be
challenging. The modeling results show not only improved accuracy, but also
runtime improvements. When compared with SVM, KNN, and MLP in QDA and FLDA,
runtime shortens by 20 times in our chosen data set simulated for a healthcare
framework. The RP filtering in the preprocessing stage of the attribute
selection, fulfilling the model's runtime, is a standpoint in the IoT industry.

With the development of medical informatization, the data related to medical
field are growing at an amazing speed, and medical big data appears. The mining
and analysis of these data plays an important role in the prediction, monitoring,
diagnosis, and treatment of tumor diseases. Therefore, this paper proposes a
clustering algorithm of the high-order simulated annealing neural network
algorithm and uses this algorithm to extract tumor disease-related big data,
constructs training set according to the relevant information mined, designs a
kind of dimension reduction model, aiming at the problem of excessive and wrong
diagnosis and treatment in the diagnosis and treatment module of tumor disease
monitoring mode, and establishes the corresponding control mechanism, so as to
optimize the tumor disease monitoring mode. The results show that the clustering 
accuracy of the high-order simulated annealing neural network algorithm on
different data sets (iris, wine, and Pima India diabetes) is 97.33%, 82.11%, and 
70.56% and the execution time is 0.75 s, 0.562 s, and 1.092 s, which are better
than those of the fast k-medoids algorithm and improved k-medoids clustering
algorithm. To sum up, the high-order simulated annealing neural network algorithm
can achieve good clustering effect in medical big data mining. The establishment 
of model M1 can reduce the probability of excessive and wrong medical treatment
and improve the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment module monitoring in
tumor disease monitoring mode.

PURPOSE: Planning target volume (PTV) definition based on Mid-Position (Mid-P)
strategy typically integrates breathing motion from tumor positions variances
along the conventional axes of the DICOM coordinate system. Tumor motion
directionality is thus neglected even though it is one of its stable
characteristics in time. We therefore propose the directional MidP approach (MidP
dir), which allows motion directionality to be incorporated into PTV margins. A
second objective consists in assessing the ability of the proposed method to
better take care of respiratory motion uncertainty.
METHODS: 11 lung tumors from 10 patients with supra-centimetric motion were
included. PTV were generated according to the MidP and MidP dir strategies
starting from planning 4D CT.
RESULTS: PTVMidP dir volume didn't differ from the PTVMidP volume: 31351 mm3
IC95% [17242-45459] vs. 31003 mm3 IC95% [ 17347-44659], p = 0.477 respectively.
PTVMidP dir morphology was different and appeared more oblong along the main
motion axis. The relative difference between 3D and 4D doses was on average
1.09%, p = 0.011 and 0.74%, p = 0.032 improved with directional MidP for D99% and
D95%. D2% was not significantly different between both approaches. The
improvement in dosimetric coverage fluctuated substantially from one lesion to
another and was all the more important as motion showed a large amplitude, some
obliquity with respect to conventional axes and small hysteresis.
CONCLUSIONS: Directional MidP method allows tumor motion to be taken into account
more tightly as a geometrical uncertainty without increasing the irradiation
volume.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In day centers, people with dementia are assigned to
specific groups to receive care according to the progression of the disease. This
article presents the design and evaluation of a dashboard aimed at facilitating
the comprehension of the progression of people with dementia to support
decision-making of healthcare professionals (HCPs) when determining patient-group
assignment.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A participatory design methodology was followed to build
the dashboard. The grounded theory methodology was utilized to identify
requirements. A total of 8 HCPs participated in the design and evaluation of a
low-fidelity prototype. The perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the
high-fidelity prototype was evaluated by 15 HCPs (from several day centers) and
38 psychology students utilizing a questionnaire based on the technology
acceptance model.
RESULTS: HCPs perceived the dashboard as extremely likely to be useful (Mdn=6.5
out of 7) and quite likely to be usable (Mdn=6 out of 7). Psychology students
perceived the dashboard as quite likely to be useful and usable (both with
Mdn=6).
CONCLUSIONS: Making use of a participatory design helped foster in HCPs a sense
of ownership of the dashboard, thus facilitating its acceptance. The creation of 
low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes led to identifying valuable, timely,
and specific feedback at different stages of the development process as well as
to establishing a set of lessons learned for the development of dashboards in the
healthcare domain.

In patients with dense breasts or at high risk of breast cancer, dynamic contrast
enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool. However, its
specificity is highly variable and sometimes low; quantitative measurements of
contrast uptake parameters may improve specificity and mitigate this issue. To
improve diagnostic accuracy, data need to be captured at high spatial and
temporal resolution. While many methods exist to accelerate MRI temporal
resolution, not all are optimized to capture breast DCE-MRI dynamics. We propose 
a novel, flexible, and powerful framework for the reconstruction of
highly-undersampled DCE-MRI data: enhancement-constrained acceleration (ECA).
Enhancement-constrained acceleration uses an assumption of smooth enhancement at 
small time-scale to estimate points of smooth enhancement curves in small time
intervals at each voxel. This method is tested in silico with physiologically
realistic virtual phantoms, simulating state-of-the-art ultrafast acquisitions at
3.5s temporal resolution reconstructed at 0.25s temporal resolution (demo code
available here). Virtual phantoms were developed from real patient data and
parametrized in continuous time with arterial input function (AIF) models and
lesion enhancement functions. Enhancement-constrained acceleration was compared
to standard ultrafast reconstruction in estimating the bolus arrival time and
initial slope of enhancement from reconstructed images. We found that the ECA
method reconstructed images at 0.25s temporal resolution with no significant loss
in image fidelity, a 4x reduction in the error of bolus arrival time estimation
in lesions (p < 0.01) and 11x error reduction in blood vessels (p < 0.01). Our
results suggest that ECA is a powerful and versatile tool for breast DCE-MRI.

Tremendous progress has been made to control the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the 
SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, effective therapeutic options are still rare. Drug
repurposing and combination represent practical strategies to address this urgent
unmet medical need. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are known to hijack host
metabolism to facilitate viral proliferation, making targeting host metabolism a 
promising antiviral approach. Here, we describe an integrated analysis of 12
published in vitro and human patient gene expression datasets on SARS-CoV-2
infection using genome-scale metabolic modeling (GEM), revealing complicated host
metabolism reprogramming during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We next applied the
GEM-based metabolic transformation algorithm to predict anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets
that counteract the virus-induced metabolic changes. We successfully validated
these targets using published drug and genetic screen data and by performing an
siRNA assay in Caco-2 cells. Further generating and analyzing RNA-sequencing data
of remdesivir-treated Vero E6 cell samples, we predicted metabolic targets acting
in combination with remdesivir, an approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. Our study
provides clinical data-supported candidate anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets for future
evaluation, demonstrating host metabolism targeting as a promising antiviral
strategy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this article is to introduce the concept of
'Big Data' and review its potential to advance scientific discovery in
obstetrics.
RECENT FINDINGS: Big Data is now ubiquitous in medicine, being used in many
specialties to understand the pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatment for
many diseases. Big Data analyses often employ machine learning methods to
understand the complex relationships that may exist within these sources. We
review the basic principles of supervised and unsupervised machine learning
methods, including deep learning. We highlight how these methods have been used
to study genetic risk factors for preterm birth, interpreting electronic fetal
heart rate tracings, and predict adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes during
pregnancy and delivery. Despite its promise, there are challenges with using Big 
Data, including data integrity, generalizability (namely the concerns about
perpetuating inequalities), and confidentiality.
SUMMARY: The combination of new data and enhanced methods present a synergistic
opportunity to explore the complex relationships common to human illness and
medical practice, including obstetrics. With prediction as a primary objective
instead of the more familiar goals of hypothesis testing, these analytic methods 
can capture multifaceted, rare, and nuanced relationships between exposures and
outcomes that exist within these large data sets.

Big data holds great promise to help unravel insights to bridge the gap in human 
understanding. There has to be an emphasis on the quality of the data points
being collected to ensure meaningful analysis. India has made significant strides
to lay down a strong framework through the National Digital Health Blueprint and 
the National Health Stack for the future. There is a need to focus on the first
important step of collection of a "good quality" data point through the
implementation of electronic medical records by the health care providers. In
India, 60 million individuals move below the poverty line every year because of
the expenses related to unforeseen illness that adversely affects the
individual's welfare and the nation's economic growth. With an out-of-pocket
expense rate currently at 70% and the government's health budget at a mere 1.3%
of its GDP (gross domestic product), data-driven decisions are the need of the
hour for policy making and to ensure equitable, efficient, and excellent delivery
of health care. There is a huge potential to harness the power of big data to
generate insights to address the four big challenges of health care in India -
availability, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability.

Economics, Hangzhou 310016, China.

People usually use the method of job analysis to understand the requirements of
each job in terms of personnel characteristics, at the same time use the method
of psychological measurement to understand the psychological characteristics of
each person, and then put the personnel in the appropriate position by matching
them with each other. With the development of the information age, massive and
complex data are produced. How to accurately extract the effective data needed by
the industry from the big data is a very arduous task. In reality, personnel data
are influenced by many factors, and the time series formed by it is more
accidental and random and often has multilevel and multiscale characteristics.
How to use a certain algorithm or data processing technology to effectively dig
out the rules contained in the personnel information data and explore the
personnel placement scheme has become an important issue. In this paper, a
multilayer variable neural network model for complex big data feature learning is
established to optimize the staffing scheme. At the same time, the learning model
is extended from vector space to tensor space. The parameters of neural network
are inversed by high-order backpropagation algorithm facing tensor space.
Compared with the traditional multilayer neural network calculation model based
on tensor space, the multimodal neural network calculation model can learn the
characteristics of complex data quickly and accurately and has obvious
advantages.

BACKGROUND: Suicide outcomes in cancer patients represent a major public health
concern. We performed an umbrella review (UR) including all meta-analyses
(MAs) and systematic reviews (SRs) published on the association between cancer
and suicide outcomes.
METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in the main scientific databases up to
January 23rd, 2021. Eligible MAs/SRs focused on all suicide phenotypes among
cancer patients. Evidence of the association was extracted; the credibility and
quality of the included studies were evaluated using ad-hoc tools, including "A
MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2-Revised" (AMSTAR-2-R).
RESULTS: Six MAs and 6 SRs were included. The standardized mortality ratio of
suicide in cancer patients was 1.5 to 1.7-fold higher than in the general
population. Risk factors for suicide outcomes among cancer patients were male sex
and older age, a cancer diagnosis within the prior year, and some specific cancer
sites. Among 107 associations, 90 (84.1%) were supported by high credibility of
evidence (class II). However, all studies reported a large heterogeneity
(I2> 50%) and the majority of them reported considerable heterogeneity (I2> 75%).
All MAs used random-effects measures. All MAs but one assessed publication bias
and only one disclosed it. The majority of MAs/SRs showed critically low quality 
based on AMSTAR-2-R.
LIMITATIONS: We could not perform additional analyses due to the limited number
of MAs.
CONCLUSIONS: This UR underlines the inflated risk for suicide among cancer
patients. Upcoming, well-designed studies are needed to account for a broader set
of variables. Several methodological issues likewise warrant attention.

BACKGROUND: Developing machine learning based depression prediction method with
information from long-term recordings is important and challenging to clinical
diagnosis of depression.
METHODS: We developed a novel two-stage feature selection algorithm conducted on 
the high-dimensional (over thirty thousand) features constructed by a
context-aware analysis on the data set of DAIC-WOZ, including audio, video, and
semantic features. The prediction performance was compared with seven reference
models. The preferred topics and feature categories related to the retained
features were also analyzed respectively.
RESULTS: Parsimonious subsets (tens of features) were selected by the proposed
method in each case of prediction. We obtained the best performance in depression
classification with F1-score as 0.96 (0.67), Precision as 1.00 (0.63), and Recall
as 0.92 (0.71) on the development set (test set). We also achieved promising
results in depression severity estimation with RMSE as 4.43 (5.11) and MAE as
3.22 (3.98), having a marginal difference with the best reference model (random
forest with 'Selected-Text' features). Five most important topics related to
depression were revealed. The audio features were predominant to the other
feature categories in depression classification while the contributions of the
three feature categories to severity estimation were almost equal.
LIMITATIONS: More depression samples in the database we used should be further
included. The second stage of feature selection is relatively time-consuming.
CONCLUSION: This pipeline of depression recognition as well as the preferred
topics and feature categories are expected to be useful in supporting the
diagnosis of psychological distress conditions.

Due to the problems related to the numerous factors affecting the spontaneous
combustion of goaf coal, such as sudden, uncertain, and dynamic changes, and the 
fact that the weight of the indexes in the prediction model of the spontaneous
combustion risk is difficult to determine, an improved Criteria Importance
Through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) modified Technique for Order of
Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution G2-(TOPSIS) dynamic prediction model
of goaf spontaneous combustion was developed. An optimal decision-making model
was established by introducing the Euclidean distance function, and the
function-driven type G2 weighting method was modified using the
differential-driven type weighting method of the CRITIC. In addition, the
comprehensive weights of each index were obtained. An update factor was
introduced to obtain the dynamic weight, and the primary-secondary relationship
of the risk factors affecting the spontaneous combustion of goaf was evaluated.
Based on the G2 weighting method, which approximates the driving function
principle of the ideal solution ranking method (TOPSIS), a G2-TOPSIS goaf
spontaneous combustion risk assessment model was established. The degree of
closeness was analyzed and the risk grade of the goaf spontaneous combustion was 
finally predicted. The sub-model was applied to the goaf of working face 1303 in 
the Jinniu Coal Mine. It was concluded that the air leakage duration was the
dominant factor inducing the risk of the spontaneous combustion of the goaf. The 
risk grade of spontaneous combustion of the goaf is Class III, and the predicted 
results are consistent with the actual situation. The improved CRITIC-G2-TOPSIS
dynamic model was demonstrated to be scientific in predicting the goaf
spontaneous combustion risk, and these research results have important
popularization and application value.

[Evaluation and management of wilderness injuries and acute illness in Iceland
during the years 2017-2018].

[Article in Icelandic]

(2)The National University Hospital of Iceland.

INTRODUCTION: In Iceland, wilderness search and rescue services are provided by
volunteer members of the Icelandic association for search and rescue (ICE-SAR).
The rescue teams respond to about 1200 calls every year, with a significant
proportion of them involving injured and sick individuals. No previous studies
have been done on the service provided by ICE-SAR teams. The aim of this study
was to obtain information about the health services provided by ICE-SAR in
Iceland.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data was obtained from the ICE-SAR's and the National
emergency call service's (112) databases. Cases that occurred during the years
2017 and 2018 that required transfer and treatment at a health clinic or hospital
were included in the study. All cases with no involvement of sick or injured and 
minor injuries managed on scene without tranport were excluded. Treatment on
scene and during transport and preliminary diagnosis made by ICE-SAR teams was
reviewed. The medical report at each treating medical facility in Iceland was
reviewed for treatment provided and final diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 189 operations with 239 individuals were included in the
study. A majority of the operations were recorded in the South region of Iceland.
The average age of individuals was 44,4 years, just over half of cases involving 
men. Accidents accounted for 86% of all cases where the most common incident was 
a fall resulting in lower extremity injury. Cardiac disease was the most common
cause for acute medical illness. On-scene treatment and use of equipment was not 
recorded in over 70% of cases.
CONCLUSION: The ICE-SAR teams provide health care on regular basis, most commonly
after accidents involving the lower extremities. Illness treated by the ICE-SAR
volunteers most commonly involves cardiac symptoms. Documentation of on-site
treatment and equipment use is incomplete.

Medical University, Jinzhou, China.

In this study, we aimed to explore cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) response-associated
genes and constructed a model to predict the prognosis of breast cancer (BRCA)
patients. Samples obtained from TCGA and GEO databases were subjected to Weighted
Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and univariate Cox and LASSO Cox
regression analysis to identify and validate the Cytoxan response-related
prognostic signature. Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis was
performed to analyze the independence of factors, and the nomogram model was
constructed by including all the independent factors. WGCNA revealed that 159
genes are significantly correlated with Cytoxan response in BRCA samples, and the
samples with a different prognosis could be effectively distinguished based on
the expression of those 159 genes. Ten genes were further selected to be related 
to the prognosis of BRCA patients, including PCDHB2, GRIK2, FRMD7, CCSER1,
PCDHGA1, PCDHA1, LRRC37A6P, PCDHGA12, ZNF486, and PCDHGB5, based on the Risk
Score model. Among them, PCDHA1 expression was validated in cells and patient
samples. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that the Risk Score is an
independent factor. Furthermore, the nomogram model showed that the predicted
survival probability is closely related to the actual survival probability. In
conclusion, we identified 159 genes potentially correlated with the Cytoxan
response of BRCA patients, which had prognostic value in BRCA.

Since its emergence in late 2019, the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with 
the evolution of its viral genome. The co-occurrence of specific amino acid
changes, collectively named 'virus variant', requires scrutiny (as variants may
hugely impact the agent's transmission, pathogenesis, or antigenicity); variant
evolution is studied using phylogenetics. Yet, never has this problem been
tackled by digging into data with ad hoc analysis techniques. Here we show that
the emergence of variants can in fact be traced through data-driven methods,
further capitalizing on the value of large collections of SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
For all countries with sufficient data, we compute weekly counts of amino acid
changes, unveil time-varying clusters of changes with similar-rapidly
growing-dynamics, and then follow their evolution. Our method succeeds in timely 
associating clusters to variants of interest/concern, provided their change
composition is well characterized. This allows us to detect variants' emergence, 
rise, peak, and eventual decline under competitive pressure of another variant.
Our early warning system, exclusively relying on deposited sequences, shows the
power of big data in this context, and concurs to calling for the wide spreading 
of public SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing for improved surveillance and control of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Forensic genetics mainly uses human biological samples as the objects, solves the
identification of biological materials related to law by detecting genetic
information, provides clues for investigation and evidences for trial, thus
facing many ethical issues. This paper put forward the ethical principles in
forensic genetics research and practice, and discussed the ethical issues in
sample collection, forensic DNA phenotyping, forensic genetic genealogy analysis,
forensic DNA database development, paternity and kinship testing, and research
data sharing. We suggest that specific ethical requirements should be formulated,
the ethical review system should be established for forensic genetics and ethical
training for practitioners should be strengthened.

Short tandem repeat (STR) markers have been widely used in forensic paternity
testing and individual identification, but the STR mutation might impact on the
forensic result interpretation. Importantly, the STR mutation rate was
underestimated due to ignoring the "hidden" mutation phenomenon in most similar
studies. Considering this, we use Slooten and Ricciardi's restricted mutation
model based on big data to obtain more accurate mutation rates for each marker.
In this paper, the mutations of 20 autosomal STRs loci (D3S1358, D1S1656,
D13S317, Penta E, D16S539, D18S51, D2S1338, CSF1PO, Penta D, TH01, vWA, D21S11,
D6S1043, D7S820, D5S818, TPOX, D8S1179, D12S391, D19S433, and FGA; The restricted
model does not include the correction factor of D6S1043, this paper calculates
remaining 19 STR loci mutation rates) were investigated in 28,313 (Total: 78,739 
individuals) confirmed parentage-testing cases in Chinese Han population. As a
result, total 1665 mutations were found in all loci, including 1614 one-steps, 34
two-steps, 8 three-steps, and 9 nonintegral mutations. The loci-specific average 
mutation rates ranged from 0.00007700 (TPOX) to 0.00459050 (FGA) in trio's and
0.00000000 (TPOX) to 0.00344850 (FGA) in duo's. We analyzed the relationship
between mutation rates of the apparent and actual, the trio's and duo's, the
paternal and maternal, respectively. The results demonstrated that the actual
mutation rates are more than the apparent mostly, and the values of
μ1"/μ2"(apparent) are also greater than μ1/μ2 (actual) commonly (μ1", μ1; μ2", μ2
are the mutation rates of one-step and two-step). Therefore, the "hidden"
mutations are identified. In addition, the mutations rates of trio's and duo's,
the paternal and maternal, exhibit significant difference. Next, those mutation
data are used to do a comparison with the studies of other Han populations in
China, which present the temporal and regional disparities. Due to the large
sample size, some rare mutation events, such as monozygotic (MZ) mutation and
"fake four-step mutation", are also reported in this study. In conclusion, the
estimation values of actual mutations are obtained based on big data, they can
not only provide basic data for the Chinese forensic DNA and population genetics 
databases, but also have important significance for the development of forensic
individual identification, paternity testing and genetics research.

1614个一步突变,34个两步突变,8个三步突变和9个非整步突变。基因座特异性的平均实际突变率在三联体中为0.00007700 (TPOX)~0.00459050
(FGA),在二联体中为0.00000000
(TPOX)~0.00344850(FGA)。此外,本研究还分析了表面和实际突变率、三联体和二联体突变率、父源和母源的突变率之间的关系。研究表明,实际突变率多大于
表面突变率,而且μ1”/μ2” (表面突变率)的比值通常也大于μ1/μ2 (实际突变率) (μ1”,μ1; μ2”,
μ2分别是一步和两步的突变率),即更多的“隐性”突变被释放出来。而且父源和母源的三联体和二联体的突变率也有存在差异。随后,将这些突变率数据与已发表的中国其他汉族人

In recent years, with the development of various high-throughput omics based
biological technologies (BT), biomedical research began to enter the era of big
data. In the face of high-dimensional, multi-domain and multi-modal biomedical
big data, scientific research requires a new paradigm of data intensive
scientific research. The vigorous development of cutting-edge information
technologies (IT) such as cloud computing, blockchain and artificial intelligence
provides technical means for the practice of this new research paradigm. Here,we 
describe the application of such cutting-edge information technologies in
biomedical big data, and propose a forward-looking prospect for the construction 
of a new paradigm supporting environment for data intensive scientific research. 
We expect to establish a new research scheme and new scientific research paradigm
integrating BT & IT technology, which can finally promote the great leap forward 
development of biomedical research.

AIM: To develop an autophagy-gene-based signature that could help to anticipate
the therapeutic effects of Colorectal Cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We downloaded the gene expression profiles of CRC samples from the
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Genes 
with significant prognostic value in CRC were screened through univariate Cox
regression analysis, while the LASSO Cox regression method was applied to screen 
optimal genes to construct the autophagy-related prognostic signature.
RESULTS: 11 autophagy genes were identified and selected for the establishment of
prognosis prediction model for CRC patients. The CRC patients were classified
into the low- and high-risk groups according to the optimal cutoff value. The
time-dependent ROC curves indicated the good performance of this model in
prognosis prediction, with AUC values of 0.66, 0.66, and 0.67 at 1, 3 and 5 years
for TCGA samples, as well as AUC values of 0.63, 0.65 and 0.64 for GEO samples,
respectively. The multivariate Cox regression analysis results confirmed risk
score as the independent marker for prognosis prediction in CRC. Besides, the
constructed nomogram also had high predictive value. The results analysis on the 
tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) relative ratios and mRNA levels of key
immune checkpoint receptors indicated the signature was closely related to immune
microenvironment of CRC in the context of TIICs and immune checkpoint receptors' 
mRNA level. The proportion of MSI-L + MSI-H in the high-risk group was higher
than that in the low-risk group. Moreover, the tumor purity was evaluated by
estimate function package suggested that lower tumor purity in CRC might lead to 
a poorer prognosis.
CONCLUSION: The autophagy-related features obtained in this study were able to
divide the CRC patients into low- and high-risk groups, which should be
contribute to the decision-making of CRC treatment.

The glycoside hydrolase 19 (GH19) is a bifunctional family of chitinases and
endolysins, which have been studied for the control of plant fungal pests, the
recycle of chitin biomass, and the treatment of multi-drug resistant bacteria.
The GH19 domain-containing sequences (22,461) were divided into a chitinase and
an endolysin subfamily by analyzing sequence networks, guided by taxonomy and the
substrate specificity of characterized enzymes. The chitinase subfamily was split
into seventeen groups, thus extending the previous classification. The endolysin 
subfamily is more diverse and consists of thirty-four groups. Despite their
sequence diversity, twenty-six residues are conserved in chitinases and
endolysins, which can be distinguished by two specific sequence patterns at six
and four positions, respectively. Their location outside the catalytic cleft
suggests a possible mechanism for substrate specificity that goes beyond the
direct interaction with the substrate. The evolution of the GH19 catalytic domain
was investigated by large-scale phylogeny. The inferred evolutionary history and 
putative horizontal gene transfer events differ from previous works. While no
clear patterns were detected in endolysins, chitinases varied in sequence length 
by up to four loop insertions, causing at least eight distinct presence/absence
loop combinations. The annotated GH19 sequences and structures are accessible via
the GH19 Engineering Database (GH19ED, https://gh19ed.biocatnet.de). The GH19ED
has been developed to support the prediction of substrate specificity and the
search for novel GH19 enzymes from neglected taxonomic groups or in regions of
the sequence space where few sequences have been described yet.

Identification of a Predictive Decision Model Using Different Data Mining
Algorithms for Diagnosing Peri-implant Health and Disease: A Cross-Sectional
Study.

Cetiner D, Isler SC, Bakirarar B, Uraz A.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine a predictive decision model for
peri-implant health and disease and to reveal the highest accuracy of prediction 
using three different data mining methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 216
patients with 542 dental implants from the Periodontology Department of Gazi
University. The implants were classified into peri-implant health, peri-implant
mucositis, and peri-implantitis groups based on established clinical and
radiographic assessments. Prediction models were created using clinical variables
in combination with possible risk factors for peri-implant diseases. Different
data mining methods (decision-tree [DT]; J48), logistic regression, and
artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron [MLP]) were compared to yield a 
better predictive decision model based on predictor variables with the highest
potential of effect.
RESULTS: The prevalence of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis among the 
participants of the specialist referral periodontal practice of the university
was 36.1% (95% CI: 29.7 to 42.5) and 34.7% (95% CI: 28.4 to 41.0) at the patient 
level, respectively. The J48 method revealed a higher prediction of peri-implant 
health and disease with an accuracy of 0.871 compared with the logistic
regression and MLP methods (0.832 and 0.852, respectively) for the present data
set. In this specific patient population, the J48 model revealed the top-level
node as "bleeding on probing (BOP)." "Maintenance therapy" and "medication use"
were noted as powerful predictors in the next split-levels.
CONCLUSION: The J48 model presented an acceptable predictive accuracy of
peri-implant health and disease. The model revealed BOP as a major predictive
clinical parameter when evaluated with possible risk factors for this patient
population.

This article presents a novel scalable character-based phylogeny algorithm for
dense viral sequencing data called SPHERE (Scalable PHylogEny with REcurrent
mutations). The algorithm is based on an evolutionary model where recurrent
mutations are allowed, but backward mutations are prohibited. The algorithm
creates rooted character-based phylogeny trees, wherein all leaves and internal
nodes are labeled by observed taxa. We show that SPHERE phylogeny is more stable 
than Nextstrain's, and that it accurately infers known transmission links from
the early pandemic. SPHERE is a fast algorithm that can process >200,000
sequences in <2 hours, which offers a compact phylogenetic visualization of
Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).

The availability of millions of SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-Coronavirus-2) sequences in public databases such as GISAID (Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) and EMBL-EBI (European Molecular
Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute) (the United Kingdom) allows
a detailed study of the evolution, genomic diversity, and dynamics of a virus
such as never before. Here, we identify novel variants and subtypes of SARS-CoV-2
by clustering sequences in adapting methods originally designed for haplotyping
intrahost viral populations. We asses our results using clustering entropy-the
first time it has been used in this context. Our clustering approach reaches
lower entropies compared with other methods, and we are able to boost this even
further through gap filling and Monte Carlo-based entropy minimization. Moreover,
our method clearly identifies the well-known Alpha variant in the U.K. and GISAID
data sets, and is also able to detect the much less represented (<1% of the
sequences) Beta (South Africa), Epsilon (California), and Gamma and Zeta (Brazil)
variants in the GISAID data set. Finally, we show that each variant identified
has high selective fitness, based on the growth rate of its cluster over time.
This demonstrates that our clustering approach is a viable alternative for
detecting even rare subtypes in very large data sets.

PURPOSE: Recent advancements in functional lung imaging have been developed to
improve clinicians' knowledge of patient pulmonary condition prior to treatment. 
Ultimately, it may be possible to employ these functional imaging modalities to
tailor radiation treatment plans to optimize patient outcome and mitigate
pulmonary complications. Parametric response mapping (PRM) is a computed
tomography (CT)-based functional lung imaging method that utilizes a voxel-wise
image analysis technique to classify lung abnormality phenotypes, and has
previously been shown to be effective at assessing lung complication risk in
diagnostic applications. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the
implementation of PRM guidance in radiotherapy treatment planning.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective study was performed with 18 lung cancer
patients to test the incorporation of PRM into a radiotherapy planning workflow. 
Paired inspiration/expiration pretreatment CT scans were acquired and PRM
analysis was utilized to classify each voxel as normal, parenchymal disease,
small airway disease, and emphysema. Density maps were generated for each PRM
classification to contour high density regions of pulmonary abnormalities.
Conventional volumetric-modulated arc therapy and PRM-guided treatment plans were
designed for each patient.
RESULTS: PRM guidance was successfully implemented into the treatment planning
process. The inclusion of PRM priorities resulted in statistically significant
(p < 0.05) improvements to the V20Gy within the PRM avoidance contours. On
average, reductions of 5.4% in the V20Gy(%) were found. The PRM-guided treatment 
plans did not significantly increase the dose to the organs at risk or result in 
insufficient planning target volume coverage, but did increase plan complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: PRM guidance was successfully implemented into a treatment planning 
workflow and shown to be effective for dose redistribution within the lung. This 
work has provided a framework for the potential clinical implementation of
PRM-guided treatment planning.

Acid suppressants are widely-used classes of medications linked to increased
risks of aerodigestive infections. Prior studies of these medications as
potentially reversible risk factors for COVID-19 have been conflicting. We aimed 
to determine the impact of chronic acid suppression use on COVID-19 infection
risk while simultaneously evaluating the influence of social determinants of
health to validate known and discover novel risk factors. We assessed the
association of chronic acid suppression with incident COVID-19 in a 1:1
case-control study of 900 patients tested across three academic medical centers
in California, USA. Medical comorbidities and history of chronic acid suppression
use were manually extracted from health records by physicians following a
pre-specified protocol. Socio-behavioral factors by geomapping publicly-available
data to patient zip codes were incorporated. We identified no evidence to support
an association between chronic acid suppression and COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratio
1.04, 95% CI 0.92-1.17, P = 0.515). However, several medical and social features 
were positive (Latinx ethnicity, BMI ≥ 30, dementia, public transportation use,
month of the pandemic) and negative (female sex, concurrent solid tumor, alcohol 
use disorder) predictors of new infection. These findings demonstrate the value
of integrating publicly-available databases with medical data to identify
critical features of communicable diseases.

Despite the volume of publications dedicated to unraveling the biological
characteristics and clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2, available data on
pregnant patients are limited. In the current review of literature, we present an
overview on the developmental course, complications, and adverse effects of
COVID-19 on pregnancy. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in 
PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central databases up to June 2021. This
article collectively presents what has been so far reported on the identified
critical aspects, namely complications during pregnancy, delivery challenges,
neonatal health care, potential routes of viral transmission, including vertical 
transmission or breastfeeding, along with the risks involved in the vaccination
strategy during pregnancy. Despite the fact that we are still largely navigating 
uncharted territory, the observed publication explosion in the field is
unprecedented. The overwhelming need for data is undoubtable, and this serves as 
the driver for the plethora of publications witnessed. Nonetheless, the quality
of data sourced is variable. In the midst of the frenzy for reporting on
SARS-CoV-2 data, monitoring this informational overload is where we should head
to next, considering that poor quality research may in fact hamper our attempts
to prevail against this unparalleled pandemic outbreak.

Considering the significant burden to patients and healthcare systems globally
related to atrial fibrillation (AF) complications, the early AF diagnosis is of
crucial importance. In the view of prominent perspectives for fast and accurate
point-of-care arrhythmia detection, our study optimizes an artificial neural
network (NN) classifier and ranks the importance of enhanced 137 diagnostic ECG
features computed from time and frequency ECG signal representations of short
single-lead strips available in 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge database. Based on 
hyperparameters' grid search of densely connected NN layers, we derive the
optimal topology with three layers and 128, 32, 4 neurons per layer
(DenseNet-3@128-32-4), which presents maximal F1-scores for classification of
Normal rhythms (0.883, 5076 strips), AF (0.825, 758 strips), Other rhythms
(0.705, 2415 strips), Noise (0.618, 279 strips) and total F1 relevant to the CinC
Challenge of 0.804, derived by five-fold cross-validation. DenseNet-3@128-32-4
performs equally well with 137 to 32 features and presents tolerable reduction by
about 0.03 to 0.06 points for limited input sets, including 8 and 16 features,
respectively. The feature reduction is linked to effective application of a
comprehensive method for computation of the feature map importance based on the
weights of the activated neurons through the total path from input to specific
output in DenseNet. The detailed analysis of 20 top-ranked ECG features with
greatest importance to the detection of each rhythm and overall of all rhythms
reveals DenseNet decision-making process, noticeably corresponding to the
cardiologists' diagnostic point of view.

Remote eye tracking technology has suffered an increasing growth in recent years 
due to its applicability in many research areas. In this paper, a
video-oculography method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pupil 
center detection over webcam images is proposed. As the first contribution of
this work and in order to train the model, a pupil center manual labeling
procedure of a facial landmark dataset has been performed. The model has been
tested over both real and synthetic databases and outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving pupil center estimation errors below the size of a constricted
pupil in more than 95% of the images, while reducing computing time by a 8
factor. Results show the importance of use high quality training data and
well-known architectures to achieve an outstanding performance.

Sensor monitoring networks and advances in big data analytics have guided the
reliability engineering landscape to a new era of big machinery data. Low-cost
sensors, along with the evolution of the internet of things and industry 4.0,
have resulted in rich databases that can be analyzed through prognostics and
health management (PHM) frameworks. Several data-driven models (DDMs) have been
proposed and applied for diagnostics and prognostics purposes in complex systems.
However, many of these models are developed using simulated or experimental data 
sets, and there is still a knowledge gap for applications in real operating
systems. Furthermore, little attention has been given to the required data
preprocessing steps compared to the training processes of these DDMs. Up to date,
research works do not follow a formal and consistent data preprocessing guideline
for PHM applications. This paper presents a comprehensive step-by-step pipeline
for the preprocessing of monitoring data from complex systems aimed for DDMs. The
importance of expert knowledge is discussed in the context of data selection and 
label generation. Two case studies are presented for validation, with the end
goal of creating clean data sets with healthy and unhealthy labels that are then 
used to train machinery health state classifiers.

Smart-Farming System.

University, Incheon 22012, Korea.

Indoor smart-farming based on artificial grow lights has gained attention in the 
past few years. In modern agricultural technology, the growth status is generally
monitored and controlled by radio-frequency communication networks. However, it
is reported that the radio frequency (RF) could negatively impact the growth rate
and the health condition of the vegetables. This work proposes an
energy-efficient solution replacing or augmenting the current RF system by
utilizing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the grow lights and adopting visible
light communications and optical camera communication for the smart-farming
systems. In particular, in the proposed system, communication data is modulated
via a 24% additional green grow LED light that is also known to be beneficial for
the growth of the vegetables. Optical cameras capture the modulated green light
reflected from the vegetables for the uplink connection. A combination of white
ceiling LEDs and photodetectors provides the downlink, enabling an RF-free
communication network as a whole. In the proposed architecture, the smart-farming
units are modularized, leading to flexible mobility. Following theoretical
analysis and simulations, a proof-of-concept demonstration presents the
feasibility of the proposed architecture by successfully demonstrating the
maximum data rates of 840 b/s (uplink) and 20 Mb/s (downlink).

Soil moisture content simulation models have continuously been an important
research objective. In particular, the comparisons of the performance of
different model types deserve proper attention. Therefore, the quality of
selected physically-based and statistical models was analyzed utilizing the data 
from the Time Domain Reflectometry technique. An E-Test measurement system was
applied with the reflectogram interpreted into soil volumetric moisture content
by proper calibration equations. The gathered data facilitated to calibrate the
physical model of Deardorff and establish parameters of: support vector machines,
multivariate adaptive regression spline, and boosted trees model. The general
likelihood uncertainty estimation revealed the sensitivity of individual model
parameters. As it was assumed, a simple structure of statistical models was
achieved but no direct physical interpretation of their parameters, contrary to a
physically-based method. The TDR technique proved useful for the calibration of
different soil moisture models and a satisfactory quality for their future
exploitation.

With the emerging interest of autonomous vehicles (AV), the performance and
reliability of the land vehicle navigation are also becoming important.
Generally, the navigation system for passenger car has been heavily relied on the
existing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in recent decades. However,
there are many cases in real world driving where the satellite signals are
challenged; for example, urban streets with buildings, tunnels, or even
underpasses. In this paper, we propose a novel method for simultaneous vehicle
dead reckoning, based on the lane detection model in GNSS-denied situations. The 
proposed method fuses the Inertial Navigation System (INS) with learning-based
lane detection model to estimate the global position of vehicle, and effectively 
bounds the error drift compared to standalone INS. The integration of INS and
lane model is accomplished by UKF to minimize linearization errors and computing 
time. The proposed method is evaluated through the real-vehicle experiments on

Recent developments in massive machine-type communication (mMTC) scenarios have
given rise to never-seen requirements, which triggered the Industry 4.0
revolution. The new scenarios bring even more pressure to comply with the
reliability and communication security and enable flawless functionality of the
critical infrastructure, e.g., smart grid infrastructure. We discuss typical
network grid architecture, communication strategies, and methods for building
scalable and high-speed data processing and storage platform. This paper focuses 
on the data transmissions using the sets of standards IEC 60870-6 (ICCP/TASE.2). 
The main goal is to introduce the TASE.2 traffic generator and the data
collection back-end with the implemented load balancing functionality to
understand the limits of current protocols used in the smart grids. To this end, 
the assessment framework enabling generating and collecting TASE.2 communication 
with long-term data storage providing high availability and load balancing
capabilities was developed. The designed proof-of-concept supports complete
cryptographic security and allows users to perform the complex testing and
verification of the TASE.2 network nodes configuration. Implemented components
were tested in a cloud-based Microsoft Azure environment in four geographically
separated locations. The findings from the testing indicate the high performance 
and scalability of the proposed platform, allowing the proposed generator to be
also used for high-speed load testing purposes. The load-balancing performance
shows the CPU usage of the load-balancer below 15% while processing 5000 messages
per second. This makes it possible to achieve up to a 7-fold improvement of
performance resulting in processing up to 35,000 messages per second.

In the present work, a neuronal dynamic response prediction system is shown to
estimate the response of multiple systems remotely without sensors. For this, a
set of Neural Networks and the response to the step of a stable system is used.
Six basic characteristics of the dynamic response were extracted and used to
calculate a Transfer Function equivalent to the dynamic model. A database with
1,500,000 data points was created to train the network system with the basic
characteristics of the dynamic response and the Transfer Function that causes it.
The contribution of this work lies in the use of Neural Network systems to
estimate the behavior of any stable system, which has multiple advantages
compared to typical linear regression techniques since, although the training
process is offline, the estimation can perform in real time. The results show an 
average 2% MSE error for the set of networks. In addition, the system was tested 
with physical systems to observe the performance with practical examples,
achieving a precise estimation of the output with an error of less than 1% for
simulated systems and high performance in real signals with the typical noise
associated due to the acquisition system.

Improved Random Forest Algorithm Based on Decision Paths for Fault Diagnosis of
Chemical Process with Incomplete Data.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemical Engineering, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.

Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) has received considerable attention with the 
advent of big data. Many data-driven FDD procedures have been proposed, but most 
of them may not be accurate when data missing occurs. Therefore, this paper
proposes an improved random forest (RF) based on decision paths, named DPRF,
utilizing correction coefficients to compensate for the influence of incomplete
data. In this DPRF model, intact training samples are firstly used to grow all
the decision trees in the RF. Then, for each test sample that possibly contains
missing values, the decision paths and the corresponding nodes importance scores 
are obtained, so that for each tree in the RF, the reliability score for the
sample can be inferred. Thus, the prediction results of each decision tree for
the sample will be assigned to certain reliability scores. The final prediction
result is obtained according to the majority voting law, combining both the
predicting results and the corresponding reliability scores. To prove the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) 
process is tested. Compared with other FDD methods, the proposed DPRF model shows
better performance on incomplete data.

MOTIVATION: Gene-environment interaction (GEI) studies are a general framework
that can be used to identify genetic variants that modify the effects of
environmental, physiological, lifestyle or treatment effects on complex traits.
Moreover, accounting for GEIs can enhance our understanding of the genetic
architecture of complex diseases and traits. However, commonly used statistical
software programs for GEI studies are either not applicable to testing certain
types of GEI hypotheses or have not been optimized for use in large samples.
RESULTS: Here, we develop a new software program, GEM (Gene-Environment
interaction analysis in Millions of samples), which supports the inclusion of
multiple GEI terms, adjustment for GEI covariates and robust inference, while
allowing multi-threading to reduce computation time. GEM can conduct GEI tests as
well as joint tests of genetic main and interaction effects for both continuous
and binary phenotypes. Through simulations, we demonstrate that GEM scales to
millions of samples while addressing limitations of existing software programs.
We additionally conduct a gene-sex interaction analysis on waist-hip ratio in
352 768 unrelated individuals from the UK Biobank, identifying 24 novel loci in
the joint test that have not previously been reported in combined or sex-specific
analyses. Our results demonstrate that GEM can facilitate the next generation of 
large-scale GEI studies and help advance our understanding of the genetic
architecture of complex diseases and traits.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: GEM is freely available as an open source
project at https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/GEM.
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics
online.

Hollow-tree super: A directional and scalable approach for feature importance in 
boosted tree models.

Author information:

PURPOSE: Current limitations in methodologies used throughout machine-learning to
investigate feature importance in boosted tree modelling prevent the effective
scaling to datasets with a large number of features, particularly when one is
investigating both the magnitude and directionality of various features on the
classification into a positive or negative class. This manuscript presents a
novel methodology, "Hollow-tree Super" (HOTS), designed to resolve and visualize 
feature importance in boosted tree models involving a large number of features.
Further, this methodology allows for accurate investigation of the directionality
and magnitude various features have on classification and incorporates
cross-validation to improve the accuracy and validity of the determined features 
of importance.
METHODS: Using the Iris dataset, we first highlight the characteristics of HOTS
by comparing it to other commonly used techniques for feature importance,
including Gini Importance, Partial Dependence Plots, and Permutation Importance, 
and explain how HOTS resolves the weaknesses present in these three strategies
for investigating feature importance. We then demonstrate how HOTS can be
utilized in high dimensional spaces such as neuroscientific setting, by taking 60
Schizophrenic subjects from the publicly available SchizConnect database and
applying the method to determine which regions of the brain were most important
for the positive and negative classification of schizophrenia as determined by
the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS).
RESULTS: HOTS effectively replicated and supported the findings of feature
importance for classification of the Iris dataset when compared to Gini
importance, Partial Dependence Plots and Permutation importance, determining
'petal length' as the most important feature for positive and negative
classification. When applied to the Schizconnect dataset, HOTS was able to
resolve from 379 independent features, the top 10 most important features for
classification, as well as their directionality for classification and magnitude 
compared to other features. Cross-validation supported that these same 10
features were consistently used in the decision-making process across multiple
trees, and these features were localised primarily to the occipital and parietal 
cortices, commonly disturbed brain regions in those afflicted with Schizophrenia.
CONCLUSION: HOTS effectively overcomes previous challenges of identifying feature
importance at scale, and can be utilized across a swathe of disciplines. As
computational power and data quantity continues to expand, it is imperative that 
a methodology is developed that is able to handle the demands of working with
large datasets that contain a large number of features. This approach represents 
a unique way to investigate both the directionality and magnitude of feature
importance when working at scale within a boosted tree model that can be easily
visualized within commonly used software.

PURPOSE: Typically stored as unstructured notes, surgical pathology reports
contain data elements valuable to cancer research that require labor-intensive
manual extraction. Although studies have described natural language processing
(NLP) of surgical pathology reports to automate information extraction, efforts
have focused on specific cancer subtypes rather than across multiple oncologic
domains. To address this gap, we developed and evaluated an NLP method to extract
tumor staging and diagnosis information across multiple cancer subtypes.
METHODS: The NLP pipeline was implemented on an open-source framework called Leo.
We used a total of 555,681 surgical pathology reports of 329,076 patients to
develop the pipeline and evaluated our approach on subsets of reports from
patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, and randomly selected cancer
subtypes.
RESULTS: Averaged across all four cancer subtypes, the NLP pipeline achieved an
accuracy of 1.00 for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision
codes, 0.89 for T staging, 0.90 for N staging, and 0.97 for M staging. It
achieved an F1 score of 1.00 for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth 
Revision codes, 0.88 for T staging, 0.90 for N staging, and 0.24 for M staging.
CONCLUSION: The NLP pipeline was developed to extract tumor staging and diagnosis
information across multiple cancer subtypes to support the research enterprise in
our institution. Although it was not possible to demonstrate generalizability of 
our NLP pipeline to other institutions, other institutions may find value in
adopting a similar NLP approach-and reusing code available at GitHub-to support
the oncology research enterprise with elements extracted from surgical pathology 
reports.

Importance: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation measures have
disrupted access to psychiatric medications, particularly for women.
Objective: To assess the sex differences in trends in the prescribing of
benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics and serotonergic (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]),
which are commonly prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, and depression.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from Clinformatics
Data Mart, one of the largest commercial health insurance databases in the US.
Enrollees 18 years or older were required to have complete enrollment in a given 
month during our study period, January 1, 2018, to March 31, 2021, to be included
for that month.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Prescription of a benzodiazepine, Z-hypnotic, or SSRI
or SNRI. For each month, the percentage of patients with benzodiazepine,
Z-hypnotic, or SSRI or SNRI prescriptions by sex was calculated.
Results: The records of 17 255 033 adults (mean [SD] age, 51.7 [19.5] years;
51.3% female) were examined in 2018, 17 340 731 adults (mean [SD] age, 52.5
[19.7] years; 51.6% female) in 2019, 16 916 910 adults (mean [SD] age, 53.7
[19.8] years; 51.9% female) in 2020, and 15 135 998 adults (mean [SD] age, 56.2
[19.8] years; 52.5% female) in 2021. Compared with men, women had a higher rate
of prescriptions for all 3 drugs classes and had larger changes in prescription
rates over time. Benzodiazepine prescribing decreased from January 2018 (women:
5.61%; 95% CI, 5.60%-5.63%; men: 3.03%; 95% CI, 3.02%-3.04%) to March 2021
(women: 4.91%; 95% CI, 4.90%-4.93%; men: 2.66%; 95% CI, 2.65%-2.67%), except for 
a slight increase in April 2020 among women. Z-hypnotic prescribing increased
from January 2020 for women (1.39%; 95% CI, 1.38%-1.40%) and February 2020 for
men (0.97%; 95% CI, 0.96%-0.98%) to October 2020 (women: 1.46%; 95% CI,
1.46%-1.47%; men: 1.00%; 95% CI, 0.99%-1.01%). Prescribing of SSRIs and SNRIs
increased from January 2018 (women: 12.77%; 95% CI; 12.75%-12.80%; men: 5.56%;
95% CI, 5.44%-5.58%) to April 2020 for men (6.73%; 95% CI, 6.71%-6.75%) and
October 2020 for women (15.18%; 95% CI, 15.16%-15.21%).
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, coinciding with the COVID-19
pandemic onset was an increase in Z-hypnotic as well as SSRI and SNRI
prescriptions in both men and women along with an increase in benzodiazepine
prescriptions in women, findings that suggest a substantial mental health impact 
of COVID-19-associated mitigation measures.

Development, Validation, and Assessment of Clinical Impact of Real-time Alerts to
Detect Inpatient As-Needed Opioid Orders With Duplicate Indications: Prospective 
Study.

BACKGROUND: As-needed (PRN) opioid orders with duplicate indications can lead to 
medication errors and opioid-related adverse drug events.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to build and validate real-time alerts 
that detect duplicate PRN opioid orders and assist clinicians in optimizing the
safety of opioid orders.
METHODS: This single-center, prospective study used an iterative, 3-step process 
to refine alert performance by advancing from small sample evaluations of
positive predictive values (PPVs) (step 1) through intensive evaluations of
accuracy (step 2) to evaluations of clinical impact (step 3). Validation cohorts 
were randomly sampled from eligible patients for each step.
RESULTS: During step 1, the PPV was 100% (one-sided, 97.5% CI 70%-100%) for
moderate and severe pain alerts. During step 2, duplication of 1 or more PRN
opioid orders was identified for 17% (34/201; 95% CI, 12%-23%) of patients during
chart review. This bundle of alerts showed 94% sensitivity (95% CI 80%-99%) and
96% specificity (95% CI 92%-98%) for identifying patients who had duplicate PRN
opioid orders. During step 3, at least 1 intervention was made to the medication 
profile for 77% (46/60; 95% CI 64%-87%) of patients, and at least 1 inappropriate
duplicate PRN opioid order was discontinued for 53% (32/60; 95% CI 40%-66%) of
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The bundle of alerts developed in this study was validated against
chart review by a pharmacist and identified patients who benefited from
medication safety interventions to optimize PRN opioid orders.

The purpose of the present work was to evaluate performance in pulmonary nodule
detection, reading times and patient doses for ultra-low dose computed tomography
(ULD-CT), standard dose chest CT (SD-CT), and digital radiography (DR). Pulmonary
nodules were simulated in an anthropomorphic lung phantom. Thirty cases, 18 with 
lesions (45 total lesions of 3-12 mm) and 12 without lesions were acquired for
each imaging modality. Three radiologists interpreted the cases in a
free-response study. Performance was assessed using the JAFROC figure-of-merit
(FOM). Performance was not significantly different between ULD-CT and SD-CT
(FOMs: 0.787 vs 0.814; ΔFOM: 0.03), but both CT techniques were superior to DR
(FOM: 0.541; ΔFOM: 0.31 and 0.28). Overall, the CT modalities took longer time to
interpret than DR. ULD chest CT may serve as an alternative to both SD-CT and
conventional radiography, considerably reducing dose in the first case and
improving diagnostic accuracy in the second.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has nearly fifty years of history and has assisted
many clinicians in the diagnosis. With the development of technology, recently,
researches use the deep learning method to get high accuracy results in the CAD
system. With CAD, the computer output can be used as a second choice for
radiologists and contribute to doctors doing the final right decisions. Chest
abnormality detection is a classic detection and classification problem;
researchers need to classify common thoracic lung diseases and localize critical 
findings. For the detection problem, there are two deep learning methods:
one-stage method and two-stage method. In our paper, we introduce and analyze
some representative model, such as RCNN, SSD, and YOLO series. In order to better
solve the problem of chest abnormality detection, we proposed a new model based
on YOLOv5 and ResNet50. YOLOv5 is the latest YOLO series, which is more flexible 
than the one-stage detection algorithms before. The function of YOLOv5 in our
paper is to localize the abnormality region. On the other hand, we use ResNet,
avoiding gradient explosion problems in deep learning for classification. And we 
filter the result we got from YOLOv5 and ResNet. If ResNet recognizes that the
image is not abnormal, the YOLOv5 detection result is discarded. The dataset is
collected via VinBigData's web-based platform, VinLab. We train our model on the 
dataset using Pytorch frame and use the mAP, precision, and F1-score as the
metrics to evaluate our model's performance. In the progress of experiments, our 
method achieves superior performance over the other classical approaches on the
same dataset. The experiments show that YOLOv5's mAP is 0.010, 0.020, 0.023
higher than those of YOLOv5, Fast RCNN, and EfficientDet. In addition, in the
dimension of precision, our model also performs better than other models. The
precision of our model is 0.512, which is 0.018, 0.027, 0.033 higher than YOLOv5,
Fast RCNN, and EfficientDet.

The objective of this paper is to study the curative effect of music combined
with hypnosis on labor pains during childbirth. Based on the algorithm of data
mining, we randomly selected 100 women who delivered babies in obstetric units
from October 2020 to June 2021, set the control group and the observation group, 
obtained the relevant clinical data through comparison, and analyzed the value of
music combined with hypnotic analgesia midwifery in obstetrics. The results
showed that the number of spontaneous delivery cases in the observation group was
higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05) and the delivery time in the
observation group was better than that in the control group (P < 0.05). It is
proved that music combined with hypnosis can effectively improve the rate of
natural childbirth and shorten the overall labor time, so as to guarantee the

As one of the oldest languages in the world, Chinese has a long cultural history 
and unique language charm. The multilayer self-organizing neural network and data
mining techniques have been widely used and can achieve high-precision prediction
in different fields. However, they are hardly applied to Chinese language feature
analysis. In order to accurately analyze the characteristics of Chinese language,
this paper uses the multilayer self-organizing neural network and the
corresponding data mining technology for feature recognition and then compared it
with other different types of neural network algorithms. The results show that
the multilayer self-organizing neural network can make the accuracy, recall, and 
F1 score of feature recognition reach 68.69%, 80.21%, and 70.19%, respectively,
when there are many samples. Under the influence of strong noise, it keeps high
efficiency of feature analysis. This shows that the multilayer self-organizing
neural network has superior performance and can provide strong support for
Chinese language feature analysis.

Clinical informatics has been described as the "relentless pursuit of assisting
people" by using data and information technology to improve health care. A core
principle is that a person supported by information technology is superior to
either a person or machine alone. Striving toward this harmonization, the
transfusion medicine field has had a significant number of accomplishments.
Clinical informatics interventions have helped achieve better quality,
efficiency, and safety in nearly all aspects of transfusion medicine. This review
summarizes these accomplishments and provides a preview of novel ideas that could
transform transfusion medicine into a proactive, data-driven, and
patient-centered discipline.

Organ segmentation, chest radiograph classification, and lung and liver nodule
detections are some of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) tasks in chest
and abdominal radiology due to the wide availability of public datasets. AI
algorithms have achieved performance comparable to humans in less time for
several organ segmentation tasks, and some lesion detection and classification
tasks. This article introduces the current published articles of AI applied to
chest and abdominal radiology, including organ segmentation, lesion detection,
classification, and predicting prognosis.

Machine learning (ML) and Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to
dramatically improve radiology practice at multiple stages of the imaging
pipeline. Most of the attention has been garnered by applications focused on
improving the end of the pipeline: image interpretation. However, this article
reviews how AI/ML can be applied to improve upstream components of the imaging
pipeline, including exam modality selection, hardware design, exam protocol
selection, data acquisition, image reconstruction, and image processing. A
breadth of applications and their potential for impact is shown across multiple
imaging modalities, including ultrasound, computed tomography, and MRI.

The potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology goes far beyond image 
analysis. AI can be used to optimize all steps of the radiology workflow by
supporting a variety of nondiagnostic tasks, including order entry support,
patient scheduling, resource allocation, and improving the radiologist's
workflow. This article discusses several principal directions of using AI
algorithms to improve radiological operations and workflow management, with the
intention of providing a broader understanding of the value of applying AI in the
radiology department.

Machine learning is an important tool for extracting information from medical
images. Deep learning has made this more efficient by not requiring an explicit
feature extraction step and in some cases detecting features that humans had not 
identified. The rapid advance of deep learning technologies continues to result
in valuable tools. The most effective use of these tools will occur when
developers also understand the properties of medical images and the clinical
questions at hand. The performance metrics also are critical for guiding the
training of an artificial intelligence and for assessing and comparing its tools.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science and
linguistics that can be applied to extract meaningful information from radiology 
reports. Symbolic NLP is rule based and well suited to problems that can be
explicitly defined by a set of rules. Statistical NLP is better situated to
problems that cannot be well defined and requires annotated or labeled examples
from which machine learning algorithms can infer the rules. Both symbolic and
statistical NLP have found success in a variety of radiology use cases. More
recently, deep learning approaches, including transformers, have gained traction 
and demonstrated good performance.

No one knows what the paradigm shift of artificial intelligence will bring to
medical imaging. In this article, we attempt to predict how artificial
intelligence will impact radiology based on a critical review of current
innovations. The best way to predict the future is to anticipate, prepare, and
create it. We anticipate that radiology will need to enhance current
infrastructure, collaborate with others, learn the challenges and pitfalls of the
technology, and maintain a healthy skepticism about artificial intelligence while
embracing its potential to allow us to become more productive, accurate, secure, 
and impactful in the care of our patients.

Artificial intelligence technology promises to redefine the practice of
radiology. However, it exists in a nascent phase and remains largely untested in 
the clinical space. This nature is both a cause and consequence of the uncertain 
legal-regulatory environment it enters. This discussion aims to shed light on
these challenges, tracing the various pathways toward approval by the US Food and
Drug Administration, the future of government oversight, privacy issues, ethical 
dilemmas, and practical considerations related to implementation in radiologist
practice.

The radiology reporting process is beginning to incorporate structured,
semantically labeled data. Tools based on artificial intelligence technologies
using a structured reporting context can assist with internal report consistency 
and longitudinal tracking. To-do lists of relevant issues could be assembled by
artificial intelligence tools, incorporating components of the patient's history.
Radiologists will review and select artificial intelligence-generated and other
data to be transmitted to the electronic health record and generate feedback for 
ongoing improvement of artificial intelligence tools. These technologies should
make reports more valuable by making reports more accessible and better able to
integrate into care pathways.

This article gives a brief overview of the development of artificial intelligence
in clinical breast imaging. For multiple decades, artificial intelligence (AI)
methods have been developed and translated for breast imaging tasks such as
detection, diagnosis, and assessing response to therapy. As imaging modalities
arise to support breast cancer screening programs and diagnostic examinations,
including full-field digital mammography, breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and
MRI, AI techniques parallel the efforts with more complex algorithms, faster
computers, and larger data sets. AI methods include human-engineered radiomics
algorithms and deep learning methods. Examples of these AI-supported clinical
tasks are given along with commentary on the future.

[Deep learning reconstruction algorithm for coronary CT angiography in assessing 
obstructive coronary artery disease caused by calcified lesions: the clinical
application value].

[Article in Chinese; Abstract available in Chinese from the publisher]

Author information: 
(1)Department of Radiology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, State Key
Laboratory of Complex Severe and Rare Diseases, Beijing 100730, China.

Objective: To investigate the image quality of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)
subjected to deep learning-based reconstruction algorithm (DLR) method and its
diagnostic performance for stenosis caused by coronary calcified lesions.
Methods: We enrolled 33 consecutive patients with known or suspected coronary
artery disease (CAD) who underwent CCTA and subsequently invasive coronary
angiography (ICA) within 1 month in the department of radiology, Peking Union
Medical College Hospital between February 2020 and February 2021. Among them,
there are 26 males and 7 females, age range from 45 to 86 (61.9±9.0) years. The
CCTA images were reconstructed with DLR and hybrid iterative reconstruction
(HIR). Image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio
(CNR) were calculated on the aorta root, left main artery, proximal left anterior
descending, left circumflex, and right coronary artery of the CCTA images and
were used to evaluate the objective image quality (IQ). Subjective IQ score was
graded using Likert four-point scale (1 for excellent and 4 for poor). The
diagnostic performance of obstructive coronary artery disease caused by calcified
lesions on CCTA subjected to DLR and HIR methods were evaluated using ICA as the 
reference standard. Results: A total of 123 lesions in 33 patients were included 
in the analysis. Image noise of DLR image was significantly lower than that on
HIR image(defined as the standard deviation of the attenuation values in the
aortic root: 18.12±3.66 vs 24.19±5.71, P<0.001), CNR and SNR of DLR image in the 
aortic root were higher (CNR:43.83±23.73 vs 26.38±9.69, P<0.001,SNR:26.66±7.83 vs
21.23±8.65, P<0.001). Subjective scores of DLR was better than HIR image
(1.12±0.41 vs 1.46±0.60,P<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of
DLR and HIR images for diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease caused by
calcified lesions were 100.0%, 77.4%, 78.9% and 100.0%, 63.5%, 65.9%%,
respectively. The number of false positive cases on DLR image decreased by 38%
compared with HIR. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence based DLR can
significantly reduce the image noise and improve the image quality of CCTA. DLR
helps to improve the diagnostic performance of CCTA in assessing obstructive
coronary artery disease caused by calcified lesions, which may have good clinical
application value.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨基于深度学习重建算法（DLR）的冠状动脉CT血管成像（CCTA）图像质量和对钙化病变所致冠状动脉狭窄的诊断价值。 方法：
前瞻性纳入2020年2月至2021年2月北京协和医院放射科确诊或拟诊冠心病的33例患者，其中男26例，女7例，年龄45~86（61.9±9.0）岁。所有患者接受C
CTA检查并于1个月内进行有创冠状动脉造影（ICA）检查。采用DLR和混合迭代重建算法（HIR）重建CCTA图像。分别在主动脉根部、左主干开口、左前降支近段、左回
旋支近段及右冠状动脉近段选取不同的感兴趣区测量两种图像的噪声、信噪比（SNR）、对比噪声比（CNR），并以Likert
4级评分法进行图像质量主观评分（1分，优秀；4分，不能诊断）。以ICA为金标准，计算基于DLR和HIR的CCTA诊断钙化斑块所致冠状动脉血流梗阻性病变的诊断效能。
结果：
共33例患者的123处病变纳入分析。DLR图像的噪声低于HIR图像（定义为主动脉根部CT值的标准差：18.12±3.66比24.19±5.71，P<0.001），
CNR和SNR均高于HIR图像（主动脉根部CNR：43.83±23.73比26.38±9.69，P<0.001，SNR：26.66±7.83比21.23±8.65
，P<0.001），主观评分优于HIR图像（1.12±0.41比1.46±0.60，P<0.001）。DLR与HIR对于诊断钙化病变所致冠状动脉血流梗阻性病变的灵
敏度、特异度和准确度分别为100.0%、77.4%、78.9%和100.0%、63.5%、65.9%。与HIR相比，DLR图像上CCTA的假阳性病例减少38%。 
结论：
基于人工智能的DLR重建算法能够显著降低CCTA图像噪声并提高图像质量。DLR有助于提高CCTA对钙化斑块所致冠状动脉血流梗阻性病变的诊断效能，具有良好的临床应用
价值。.

BACKGROUND: Understanding the occurrence of yellow fever epidemics is critical
for targeted interventions and control efforts to reduce the burden of disease.
We assessed data on the yellow fever incidence and mortality rates in Africa.
METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed,
Embase, Africa-wide and Web of science databases from 1 January 1975 to 30th
October 2020. Two authors extracted data from included studies independently and 
conducted a meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Of 840 studies identified, 12 studies were deemed eligible for
inclusion. The incidence of yellow fever per 100,000 population ranged from < 1
case in Nigeria, < 3 cases in Uganda, 13 cases in Democratic Republic of the
Congo, 27 cases in Kenya, 40 cases in Ethiopia, 46 cases in Gambia, 1267 cases in
Senegal, and 10,350 cases in Ghana. Case fatality rate associated with yellow
fever outbreaks ranged from 10% in Ghana to 86% in Nigeria. The mortality rate
ranged from 0.1/100,000 in Nigeria to 2200/100,000 in Ghana.
CONCLUSION: The yellow fever incidence rate is quite constant; in contrast, the
fatality rates vary widely across African countries over the study period.
Standardized demographic health surveys and surveillance as well as accurate
diagnostic measures are essential for early recognition, treatment and control.

BACKGROUND: The wealth of biological information available nowadays in public
databases has triggered an unprecedented rise in multi-database search and data
retrieval for obtaining detailed information about key functional and structural 
entities. This concerns investigations ranging from gene or genome analysis to
protein structural analysis. However, the retrieval of interconnected data from a
number of different databases is very often done repeatedly in an unsystematic
way.
RESULTS: Here, we present TAxonomy, Gene, Ontology, Protein, Structure INtegrated
(TAGOPSIN), a command line program written in Java for rapid and systematic
retrieval of select data from seven of the most popular public biological
databases relevant to comparative genomics and protein structure studies. The
program allows a user to retrieve organism-centred data and assemble them in a
single data warehouse which constitutes a useful resource for several biological 
applications. TAGOPSIN was tested with a number of organisms encompassing
eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. For example, it successfully integrated data
for about 17,000 UniProt entries of Homo sapiens and 21 UniProt entries of human 
coronavirus.
CONCLUSION: TAGOPSIN demonstrates efficient data integration whereby manipulation
of interconnected data is more convenient than doing multi-database queries. The 
program facilitates for instance interspecific comparative analyses of
protein-coding genes in a molecular evolutionary study, or identification of
taxa-specific protein domains and three-dimensional structures. TAGOPSIN is
available as a JAR file at https://github.com/ebundhoo/TAGOPSIN and is released

INTRODUCTION: Gamma pass percentage (GPP) is the predominant metric used for
Patient Specific Quality Assurance (PSQA) in radiation therapy. The
dimensionality of the measurement geometry in PSQA has evolved from 2D planar to 
3D planar, and presently to state-of-the-art 3D volumetric geometry. We aim to
critically examine the performance of the three-dimensional gammas vis-à-vis the 
older gamma metrics of lower dimensionality to determine their mutual fungibility
in PSQA, using clinically approved Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) plans.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Gamma pass percentages derived from PSQA for VMAT plans
using Octavius 4D phantom with 2D-Array 1500 and its proprietary software were
recorded. 2D planar, 3D planar, and 3D volumetric gamma pass percentages were
retrospectively extracted for multiple treatment plans at three sites, using
three acceptance limits, and for two modes of normalization. The differences in
mean pass percentages, and the pairwise correlation between geometries were
calculated within limits of statistical significance.
RESULTS: A significant increase in mean pass rates was observed from 2D planar to
3D planar geometries. The difference was less pronounced from 3D planar to 3D
volumetric. 2D planar v/s 3D planar showed a significant degree of correlation
among themselves, which was not seen against most of the 3D volumetric pass
rates.
CONCLUSION: The mean gamma pass rates show conclusive evidence of the benefits of
shifting from 2D planar to higher dimensions measurement geometries, but the
benefits of using 3D volumetric compared to 3D planar is not always unequivocal. 
The correlations show mixed results regarding the interdependence of pass
percentages at different geometries.

PURPOSE: The objective of this work is to explore a methodology to enable plan
transfers from Standard MLC (STD) to High Definition MLC (HD) Varian units
without replanning. Using "Plan Transformation", we aim to utilize full
departmental capacity to disperse patients from STD Varian units to HD units,
when the former goes down for repair.
METHODS: Our centre is equipped with four STD and two HD MLC Varian Truebeam
units. Plan transformation is used to transfer patients from STD to HD units when
needed. Static or manually segmented fields with Y jaws ≤ 21.6 cm are eligible
for plan transformation. The MLC pattern for each field is exported out of
Eclipse. An in-house program based on C# is used to convert those patterns from
STD to HD. STD and HD MLCs are different in design but dosimetrically comparable 
for these type of plans. Still to avoid extra uncertainty, transformed plans are 
recalculated in Eclipse to enable the user to assess the quality of the process.
RESULTS: On a given day, more than 25% of appointments on STD units were eligible
for transformation. The majority of eligible plans were breast tangent and boost.
The delivery and safety of plan transformation was examined directly on a Varian 
Truebeam linac. A gamma analysis comparison between measured and calculated
transformed plans yields a pass-rate of 100% for 3%/3mm, identical to
non-transformed plans.
CONCLUSION: Plan transformation is feasible and saves time for planners as it
takes less than a quarter the time required for a replan.

PURPOSE: To create synthetic CTs and digital reconstructed radiographs (DRRs)
from MR images that allow for fiducial visualization and accurate dose
calculation for MR-only radiosurgery.
METHODS: We developed a machine learning model to create synthetic CTs from
pelvic MRs for prostate treatments. This model has been previously proven to
generate synthetic CTs with accuracy on par or better than alternate methods,
such as atlas-based registration. Our dataset consisted of 11 paired CT and
conventional MR (T2) images used for previous CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc)
radiotherapy treatments. The MR images were pre-processed to mimic the appearance
of fiducial-enhancing images. Two models were trained for each parameter case,
using a sub-set of the available image pairs, with the remaining images set aside
for testing and validation of the model to identify the optimal patch size and
number of image pairs used for training. Four models were then trained using the 
identified parameters and used to generate synthetic CTs, which in turn were used
to generate DRRs at angles 45° and 315°, as would be used for a CyberKnife
treatment. The synthetic CTs and DRRs were compared visually and using the mean
squared error and peak signal-to-noise ratio against the ground-truth images to
evaluate their similarity.
RESULTS: The synthetic CTs, as well as the DRRs generated from them, gave similar
visualization of the fiducial markers in the prostate as the true counterparts.
There was no significant difference found for the fiducial localization for the
CTs and DRRs. Across the 8 DRRs analyzed, the mean MSE between the normalized
true and synthetic DRRs was 0.66 ± 0.42% and the mean PSNR for this region was
22.9 ± 3.7 dB. For the full CTs, the mean MAE was 72.9 ± 88.1 HU and the mean
PSNR was 31.2 ± 2.2 dB.
CONCLUSIONS: Our machine learning-based method provides a proof of concept of a
way to generate synthetic CTs and DRRs for accurate dose calculation and fiducial
localization for use in radiation treatment of the prostate.

INTRODUCTION: Limited evidence exists showing the benefit of magnetic resonance
(MR)-only radiotherapy treatment planning for anal and rectal cancers. This study
aims to assess the impact of MR-only planning on target volumes (TVs) and
treatment plan doses to organs at risks (OARs) for anal and rectal cancers versus
a computed tomography (CT)-only pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients (29 rectum and 17 anus) undergoing
preoperative or radical external beam radiotherapy received CT and T2 MR
simulation. TV and OARs were delineated on CT and MR, and volumetric arc therapy 
treatment plans were optimized independently (53.2 Gy/28 fractions for anus,
45 Gy/25 fractions for rectum). Further treatment plans assessed gross tumor
volume (GTV) dose escalation. Differences in TV volumes and OAR doses, in terms
of Vx Gy (organ volume (%) receiving x dose (Gy)), were assessed.
RESULTS: MR GTV and primary planning TV (PTV) volumes systematically reduced by
13 cc and 98 cc (anus) and 44 cc and 109 cc (rectum) respectively compared to CT 
volumes. Statistically significant OAR dose reductions versus CT were found for
bladder and uterus (rectum) and bladder, penile bulb, and genitalia (anus). With 
GTV boosting, statistically significant dose reductions were found for sigmoid,
small bowel, vagina, and penile bulb (rectum) and vagina (anus).
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence that the introduction of MR (whether
through MR-only or CT-MR pathways) to radiotherapy treatment planning for anal
and rectal cancers has the potential to improve treatments. MR-related OAR dose
reductions may translate into less treatment-related toxicity for patients or
greater ability to dose escalate.

BACKGROUND: Protein subcellular localization prediction plays an important role
in biology research. Since traditional methods are laborious and time-consuming, 
many machine learning-based prediction methods have been proposed. However, most 
of the proposed methods ignore the evolution information of proteins. In order to
improve the prediction accuracy, we present a deep learning-based method to
predict protein subcellular locations.
RESULTS: Our method utilizes not only amino acid compositions sequence but also
evolution matrices of proteins. Our method uses a bidirectional long short-term
memory network that processes the entire protein sequence and a convolutional
neural network that extracts features from protein sequences. The position
specific scoring matrix is used as a supplement to protein sequences. Our method 
was trained and tested on two benchmark datasets. The experiment results show
that our method yields accurate results on the two datasets with an average
precision of 0.7901, ranking loss of 0.0758 and coverage of 1.2848.
CONCLUSION: The experiment results show that our method outperforms five methods 
currently available. According to those experiments, we can see that our method
is an acceptable alternative to predict protein subcellular location.

Prediction of linear B cell epitopes is of interest for the production of
antigen-specific antibodies and the design of peptide-based vaccines. Here, we
present BCEPS, a web server for predicting linear B cell epitopes tailored to
select epitopes that are immunogenic and capable of inducing cross-reactive
antibodies with native antigens. BCEPS implements various machine learning models
trained on a dataset including 555 linearized conformational B cell epitopes that
were mined from antibody-antigen protein structures. The best performing model,
based on a support vector machine, reached an accuracy of 75.38% ± 5.02. In an
independent dataset consisting of B cell epitopes retrieved from the Immune
Epitope Database (IEDB), this model achieved an accuracy of 67.05%. In BCEPS,
predicted epitopes can be ranked according to properties such as flexibility,
accessibility and hydrophilicity, and with regard to immunogenicity, as judged by
their predicted presentation by MHC II molecules. BCEPS also detects if predicted
epitopes are located in ectodomains of membrane proteins and if they possess
N-glycosylation sites hindering antibody recognition. Finally, we exemplified the
use of BCEPS in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, showing that it can identify B cell
epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious to humans and has caused a pandemic of 
global proportions. Despite worldwide research efforts, efficient targeted
therapies against the virus are still lacking. With the ready availability of the
macromolecular structures of coronavirus and its known variants, the search for
anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics through in silico analysis has become a highly
promising field of research. In this study, we investigate the inhibiting
potentialities of triazole-based compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease
(Mpro). The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is known to play a prominent role in 
the processing of polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. Compounds 
were pre-screened from 171 candidates (collected from the DrugBank database). The
results showed that four candidates (Bemcentinib, Bisoctrizole, PYIITM, and
NIPFC) had high binding affinity values and had the potential to interrupt the
main protease (Mpro) activities of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pharmacokinetic
parameters of these candidates were assessed and through molecular dynamic (MD)
simulation their stability, interaction, and conformation were analyzed. In
summary, this study identified the most suitable compounds for targeting Mpro,
and we recommend using these compounds as potential drug molecules against
SARS-CoV-2 after follow up studies.

The main objective of this pilot study was to determine the association between
augmented renal clearance (ARC), urinary nitrogen loss and muscle wasting in
critically ill trauma patients. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a local 
database in 162 critically ill trauma patients without chronic renal dysfunction.
Nutritional-related parameters and 24 h urinary biochemical analyses were
prospectively collected and averaged over the first ten days after admission.
Augmented renal clearance was defined by a mean creatinine clearance (CLCR) > 130
mL/min/1.73 m2. The main outcome was the cumulated nitrogen balance at day 10.
The secondary outcome was the variation of muscle psoas cross-sectional area
(ΔCSA) calculated in the subgroup of patients who underwent at least two
abdominal CT scans during the ICU length of stay. Overall, there was a
significant correlation between mean CLCR and mean urinary nitrogen loss
(normalized coefficient: 0.47 ± 0.07, p < 0.0001). ARC was associated with a
significantly higher urinary nitrogen loss (17 ± 5 vs. 14 ± 4 g/day, p < 0.0001) 
and a lower nitrogen balance (-6 ± 5 vs. -4 ± 5 g/day, p = 0.0002), without
difference regarding the mean protein intake (0.7 ± 0.2 vs. 0.7 ± 0.3 g/kg/day, p
= 0.260). In the subgroup of patients who underwent a second abdominal CT scan (N
= 47), both ΔCSA and %ΔCSA were higher in ARC patients (-33 [-41; -25] vs. -15
[-29; -5] mm2/day, p = 0.010 and -3 [-3; -2] vs. -1 [-3; -1] %/day, p = 0.008).
Critically ill trauma patients with ARC are thus characterized by a lower
nitrogen balance and increased muscle loss over the 10 first days after ICU
admission. The interest of an increased protein intake (>1.5 g/kg/day) in such
patients remains a matter of controversy and must be confirmed by further
randomized trials.

Comprehensive food lists and databases are a critical input for programs aiming
to alleviate undernutrition. However, standard methods for developing them may
produce databases that are irrelevant for marginalised groups where nutritional
needs are highest. Our study provides a method for identifying critical
contextual information required to build relevant food lists for Indigenous
populations. For our study, we used mixed-methods study design with a
community-based approach. Between July and October 2019, we interviewed 74
participants among Batwa and Bakiga communities in south-western Uganda. We
conducted focus groups discussions (FGDs), individual dietary surveys and markets
and shops assessment. Locally validated information on foods consumed among
Indigenous populations can provide results that differ from foods listed in the
national food composition tables; in fact, the construction of food lists is
influenced by multiple factors such as food culture and meaning of food,
environmental changes, dietary transition, and social context. Without using a
community-based approach to understanding socio-environmental contexts, we would 
have missed 33 commonly consumed recipes and foods, and we would not have known
the variety of ingredients' quantity in each recipe, and traditional foraged
foods. The food culture, food systems and nutrition of Indigenous and vulnerable 
communities are unique, and need to be considered when developing food lists.

l-Serine (Ser) is synthesized de novo from 3-phosphoglycerate via the
phosphorylated pathway committed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh). A
previous study reported that feeding a protein-free diet increased the enzymatic 
activity of Phgdh in the liver and enhanced Ser synthesis in the rat liver.
However, the nutritional and physiological functions of Ser synthesis in the
liver remain unclear. To clarify the physiological significance of de novo Ser
synthesis in the liver, we generated liver hepatocyte-specific Phgdh KO (LKO)
mice using an albumin-Cre driver. The LKO mice exhibited a significant gain in
body weight compared to Floxed controls at 23 weeks of age and impaired systemic 
glucose metabolism, which was accompanied by diminished insulin/IGF signaling.
Although LKO mice had no apparent defects in steatosis, the molecular signatures 
of inflammation and stress responses were evident in the liver of LKO mice.
Moreover, LKO mice were more vulnerable to protein starvation than the Floxed
mice. These observations demonstrate that Phgdh-dependent de novo Ser synthesis
in liver hepatocytes contributes to the maintenance of systemic glucose
tolerance, suppression of inflammatory response, and resistance to protein
starvation.

We previously showed that supplementation of a high fat diet with paramylon (PM) 
reduces the postprandial glucose rise, serum total and LDL cholesterol levels,
and abdominal fat accumulation in mice. The purpose of this study was to explore 
the underlying mechanism of PM using microarray analysis. Male mice (C57BL/BL
strain) were fed an experimental diet (50% fat energy) containing 5% PM isolated 
from Euglena gracilis EOD-1 for 12 weeks. After confirming that PM had an
improving effect on lipid metabolism, we assessed ileal and hepatic mRNA
expression using DNA microarray and subsequent analysis by gene ontology (GO)
classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
analysis. The results suggested that dietary supplementation with PM resulted in 
decreased abdominal fat accumulation and serum LDL cholesterol concentrations via
suppression of the digestion and absorption pathway in the ileum and activation
of the hepatic PPAR signaling pathway. Postprandial glucose rise was reduced in
mice fed PM, whereas changes in the glucose metabolism pathway were not detected 
in GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis. PM intake might enhance serum
secretory immunoglobulin A concentrations via promotion of the immunoglobulin
production pathway in the ileum.

The global food system is facing multiple problems, including rising food
insecurity, degrading environments, and an increased incidence of diet-related
chronic diseases. International organizations are thus calling for a transition
toward territorialized food systems to alleviate some of these challenges. Yet,
limited evidence supporting the benefits of territorialized food systems is
available. Our objective was to summarize the current body of literature on
territorialized food systems and their impacts on human health, food security,
and the environment using a rapid review methodology. Articles were retrieved
from three databases and analyzed using keywords and inclusion criteria
corresponding to territorialized food systems, environment, human health, and
food security. Six relevant publications were identified. While this limited
evidence suggests that territorialized food systems may have positive effects on 
all three dimensions, data are not consistent across publications. For example,
territorialized food systems may contribute to improved diet quality, provide
agroecosystem services, and contribute to food security. However, food produced
within these food systems may have a higher carbon footprint and be less
available than industrially produced food. This rapid review also highlights the 
siloed nature of the current research on territorialized food systems and
emphasizes the need for more holistic and interdisciplinary research.

Eating disorders (EDs) are often reported to have the highest mortality of any
mental health disorder. However, this assertion is based on clinical samples,
which may provide an inaccurate view of the actual risks in the population.
Hence, in the current retrospective cohort study, mortality of self-reported
lifetime history of EDs in the general population was explored. The data source
was the Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health and Well-Being (CCHS
1.2), linked to a national mortality database. The survey sample was
representative of the Canadian household population (mean age = 43.95 years,
50.9% female). The survey inquired about the history of professionally diagnosed 
chronic conditions, including EDs. Subsequently, the survey dataset was linked to
the national mortality dataset (for the date of death) up to 2017. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to explore the effect of EDs on mortality. 
The unadjusted-hazard ratio (HR) for the lifetime history of an ED was 1.35 (95% 
CI 0.70-2.58). However, the age/sex-adjusted HR increased to 4.5 (95% CI
2.33-8.84), which was over two times higher than age/sex-adjusted HRs for other
mental disorders (schizophrenia/psychosis, mood-disorders, and post-traumatic
stress disorder). In conclusion, all-cause mortality of self-reported lifetime
history of EDs in the household population was markedly elevated and considerably
higher than that of other self-reported disorders. This finding replicates prior 
findings in a population-representative sample and provides a definitive
quantification of increased risk of mortality in EDs, which was previously
lacking. Furthermore, it highlights the seriousness of EDs and an urgent need for
strategies that may help to improve long-term outcomes.

The risks associated with landslides are increasing the personal losses and
material damages in more and more areas of the world. These natural disasters are
related to geological and extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., earthquakes,
hurricanes) occurring in regions that have already suffered similar previous
natural catastrophes. Therefore, to effectively mitigate the landslide risks, new
methodologies must better identify and understand all these landslide hazards
through proper management. Within these methodologies, those based on assessing
the landslide susceptibility increase the predictability of the areas where one
of these disasters is most likely to occur. In the last years, much research has 
used machine learning algorithms to assess susceptibility using different sources
of information, such as remote sensing data, spatial databases, or geological
catalogues. This study presents the first attempt to develop a methodology based 
on an automatic machine learning (AutoML) framework. These frameworks are
intended to facilitate the development of machine learning models, with the aim
to enable researchers focus on data analysis. The area to test/validate this
study is the center and southern region of Guerrero (Mexico), where we compare
the performance of 16 machine learning algorithms. The best result achieved is
the extra trees with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.983. This methodology
yields better results than other similar methods because using an AutoML
framework allows to focus on the treatment of the data, to better understand
input variables and to acquire greater knowledge about the processes involved in 
the landslides.

Resilience is an important issue in urban development, and community resilience
(CR) is the most typical representative in building urban resilience, which has
become the forefront of international resilience research. This paper presents a 
bibliometric and visual analysis of community resilience research collected from 
the WoS Core Collection database over the past two decades. H-index, citation
frequency, centrality and starting year were adopted to analyze the research
objects by bibliometric tools including CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and Gephi. The
national and institutional characteristics of macro-geographical distribution and
the characteristics of disciplines, journals, authors, and author cooperation of 
micro-knowledge network distribution were revealed. Finally, the potential
research directions of community resilience in the future were discussed. The
results show that there are three stages in community resilience research. Seven 
intellectual bases constitute the research background for community resilience,
including social capital mechanism, the evolution of resilience knowledge,
earthquake resistance and disaster mitigation, substance abuse, resilient
development in rural communities, resilience-building in the least-developed
countries, and emergency preparedness. Our analysis shows that the hottest
community resilience research topics are the concept of resilience, climate
resilience, the social capital mechanism, macro-environment and
disaster-reduction policies, and an evaluation index system for community
resilience.

We examined the association between otitis media (OM) and educational attainment 
in a retrospective population cohort of Western Australian children who
participated in the grade 3 National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy in 
2012 (N = 19,262). Literacy and numeracy scores were linked to administrative
hospital and emergency department data to identify secondary care episodes for
OM. Results of multivariate multilevel models showed that children with OM
episodes had increased odds of poor performance on literacy and numeracy tests,
compared to children without OM episodes (46-79% increase in odds for Aboriginal 
children; 20-31% increase in odds for non-Aboriginal children). There were no
significant effects found for age at the first episode, nor for OM episode
frequency (all ps > 0.05). Regardless of the timing or frequency of episodes,
children with OM episodes are at risk of poor literacy and numeracy attainment.
Aboriginal children with OM appeared to be particularly at risk of poor literacy 
and numeracy achievement. Intervention to reduce the prevalence of otitis media
in young children, and early treatment of OM, are important for limiting the
negative effects on academic outcomes.

Electrocardiogram Fiducial Point Detector Using a Bilateral Filter and
Symmetrical Point-Filter Structure.

(1)Daegu-Gyeongbuk Research Center, Electronics and Telecommunications Research
Institute, Daegu 42994, Korea.

The characteristics or aspects of important fiducial points (FPs) in the
electrocardiogram (ECG) signal are complicated because of various factors, such
as non-stationary effects and low signal-to-noise ratio. Due to the various
noises caused by the ECG signal measurement environment and by typical ECG signal
deformation due to heart diseases, detecting such FPs becomes a challenging task.
In this study, we introduce a novel PQRST complex detector using a
one-dimensional bilateral filter (1DBF) and the temporal characteristics of FPs. 
The 1DBF with noise suppression and edge preservation preserves the P- or T-wave 
whereas it suppresses the QRS-interval. The 1DBF acts as a background predictor
for predicting the background corresponding to the P- and T-waves and the
remaining flat interval excluding the QRS-interval. The R-peak and QRS-interval
are founded by the difference of the original ECG signal and the predicted
background signal. Then, the Q- and S-points and the FPs related to the P- and
T-wave are sequentially detected using the determined searching range and
detection order based on the detected R-peak. The detection performance of the
proposed method is analyzed through the MIT-BIH database (MIT-DB) and the QT
database (QT-DB).

Reducing the disparities in healthcare access is one of the important goals in
healthcare services and is significant for national health. However, measuring
the complexity of access in truly underserved areas is the critical step in
designing and implementing healthcare policy to improve those services and to
provide additional support. Even though there are methods and tools for modeling 
healthcare accessibility, the context of data is challenging to interpret at the 
local level for targeted program implementation due to its complexity. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to develop a concise and context-specific
methodology for assessing disparities for a remote province in Thailand to assist
in the development and expansion of the efficient use of additional mobile health
clinics. We applied the geographic information system (GIS) methodology with the 
travel time-based approach to visualize and analyze the concealed information of 
spatial data in the finer analysis resolution of the study area, which was
located in the border region of the country, Ubon Ratchathani, to identify the
regional differences in healthcare allocation. Our results highlight the
significantly inadequate level of accessibility to healthcare services in the
regions. We found that over 253,000 of the population lived more than half an
hour away from a hospital. Moreover, the relationships of the vulnerable
residents and underserved regions across the province are underlined in the study
and substantially discussed in terms of expansion of mobile health delivery to
embrace the barrier of travel duration to reach healthcare facilities.
Accordingly, this research study addresses regional disparities and provides
valuable references for governmental authorities and health planners in
healthcare strategy design and intervention to minimize the inequalities in
healthcare services.

Frequent lane changes cause serious traffic safety concerns for road users. The
detection and categorization of significant factors affecting frequent lane
changing could help to reduce frequent lane-changing risk. The main objective of 
this research study is to assess and prioritize the significant factors and
sub-factors affecting frequent lane changing designed in a three-level
hierarchical structure. As a multi-criteria decision-making methodology (MCDM),
this study utilizes the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with the
best-worst method (BWM) to compare and quantify the specified factors. To
illustrate the applicability of the proposed model, a real-life decision-making
problem is considered, prioritizing the most significant factors affecting lane
changing based on the driver's responses on a designated questionnaire survey.
The proposed model observed fewer pairwise comparisons (PCs) with more consistent
and reliable results than the conventional AHP. For level 1 of the three-level
hierarchical structure, the AHP-BWM model results show "traffic characteristics" 
(0.5148) as the most significant factor affecting frequent lane changing,
followed by "human" (0.2134), as second-ranked factor. For level 2, "traffic
volume" (0.1771) was observed as the most significant factor, followed by "speed"
(0.1521). For level 3, the model results show "average speed" (0.0783) as
first-rank factor, followed by the factor "rural" (0.0764), as compared to other 
specified factors. The proposed integrated approach could help decision-makers to
focus on highlighted significant factors affecting frequent lane-changing to
improve road safety.

Extracting clinical concepts, such as problems, diagnosis, and treatment, from
unstructured clinical narrative documents enables data-driven approaches such as 
machine and deep learning to support advanced applications such as clinical
decision-support systems, the assessment of disease progression, and the
intelligent analysis of treatment efficacy. Various tools such as cTAKES, Sophia,
MetaMap, and other rules-based approaches and algorithms have been used for
automatic concept extraction. Recently, machine- and deep-learning approaches
have been used to extract, classify, and accurately annotate terms and phrases.
However, the requirement of an annotated dataset, which is labor-intensive,
impedes the success of data-driven approaches. A rule-based mechanism could
support the process of annotation, but existing rule-based approaches fail to
adequately capture contextual, syntactic, and semantic patterns. This study
intends to introduce a comprehensive rule-based system that automatically
extracts clinical concepts from unstructured narratives with higher accuracy and 
transparency. The proposed system is a pipelined approach, capable of recognizing
clinical concepts of three types, problem, treatment, and test, in the dataset
collected from a published repository as a part of the I2b2 challenge 2010. The
system's performance is compared with that of three existing systems: Quick UMLS,
BIO-CRF, and the Rules (i2b2) model. Compared to the baseline systems, the
average F1-score of 72.94% was found to be 13% better than Quick UMLS, 3% better 
than BIO CRF, and 30.1% better than the Rules (i2b2) model. Individually, the
system performance was noticeably higher for problem-related concepts, with an
F1-score of 80.45%, followed by treatment-related concepts and test-related
concepts, with F1-scores of 76.06% and 55.3%, respectively. The proposed
methodology significantly improves the performance of concept extraction from
unstructured clinical narratives by exploiting the linguistic and lexical
semantic features. The approach can ease the automatic annotation process of
clinical data, which ultimately improves the performance of supervised
data-driven applications trained with these data.

SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, represents a new 
pathogen from the family of Coronaviridae that caused a global pandemic of
COVID-19 disease. In the absence of effective antiviral drugs, research of novel 
therapeutic targets such as SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
becomes essential. This viral protein is without a human counterpart and thus
represents a unique prospective drug target. However, in vitro biological
evaluation testing on RdRp remains difficult and is not widely available.
Therefore, we prepared a database of commercial small-molecule compounds and
performed an in silico high-throughput virtual screening on the active site of
the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using ensemble docking. We identified a novel thioether-amide
or guanidine-linker class of potential RdRp inhibitors and calculated favorable
binding free energies of representative hits by molecular dynamics simulations
coupled with Linear Interaction Energy calculations. This innovative procedure
maximized the respective phase-space sampling and yielded non-covalent inhibitors
representing small optimizable molecules that are synthetically readily
accessible, commercially available as well as suitable for further biological
evaluation and mode of action studies.

During a psychotherapy session, the counselor typically adopts techniques which
are codified along specific dimensions (e.g., 'displays warmth and confidence',
or 'attempts to set up collaboration') to facilitate the evaluation of the
session. Those constructs, traditionally scored by trained human raters, reflect 
the complex nature of psychotherapy and highly depend on the context of the
interaction. Recent advances in deep contextualized language models offer an
avenue for accurate in-domain linguistic representations which can lead to robust
recognition and scoring of such psychotherapy-relevant behavioral constructs, and
support quality assurance and supervision. In this work, we propose a BERT-based 
model for automatic behavioral scoring of a specific type of psychotherapy,
called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), where prior work is limited to
frequency-based language features and/or short text excerpts which do not capture
the unique elements involved in a spontaneous long conversational interaction.
The model focuses on the classification of therapy sessions with respect to the
overall score achieved on the widely-used Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS), 
but is trained in a multi-task manner in order to achieve higher
interpretability. BERT-based representations are further augmented with available
therapy metadata, providing relevant non-linguistic context and leading to
consistent performance improvements. We train and evaluate our models on a set of
1,118 real-world therapy sessions, recorded and automatically transcribed. Our
best model achieves an F1 score equal to 72.61% on the binary classification task
of low vs. high total CTRS.

BACKGROUND: Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the most common
malignant tumors. However, the etiology and exact molecular mechanism of LIHC are
still not fully understood, which makes it urgent for us to further study the
molecular events behind.
METHODS: In this study, differences in mRNA expression between LIHC samples and
normal adjacent samples were found through analyzing the TCGA database, and key
targets were sought. We analyzed 371 LIHC samples and 50 normal adjacent samples 
according to P <0.01 and logFC>2.5, a total of 1092 genes were identified
differentially expressed, including 995 up-regulated genes and 97 down-regulated 
genes. We predicted the interactions of these differentially expressed mRNAs, and
used Cyto-Hubba to locate the hub gene-dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 
(DYNC1I1).
RESULTS: Survival analysis showed that DYNC1I1 was a prognostic factor for LIHC
male patients. Functional enrichment indicated that DYNC1I1 and differentially
expressed interacting proteins were involved in the cell cycle.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study discovers that DYNC1I1 can be used as a
prognostic marker for LIHC male patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the dosimetric accuracy of synthetic computed tomography 
(sCT) images generated by a clinically-ready voxel-based MRI simulation package, 
and to develop a simple and feasible method to improve the accuracy.
METHODS: 20 patients with brain tumor were selected to undergo CT and MRI
simulation. sCT images were generated by a clinical MRI simulation package. The
discrepancy between planning CT and sCT in CT number and body contour were
evaluated. To resolve the discrepancies, an sCT specific CT-relative electron
density (RED) calibration curve was used, and a layer of pseudo-skin was created 
on the sCT. The dosimetric impact of these discrepancies, and the improvement
brought about by the modifications, were evaluated by a planning study.
Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) treatment plans for each patient were
created and optimized on the planning CT, which were then transferred to the
original sCT and the modified-sCT for dose re-calculation. Dosimetric comparisons
and gamma analysis between the calculated doses in different images were
performed.
RESULTS: The average gamma passing rate with 1%/1 mm criteria was only 70.8% for 
the comparison of dose distribution between planning CT and original sCT. The
mean dose difference between the planning CT and the original sCT were -1.2% for 
PTV D95 and -1.7% for PTV Dmax, while the mean dose difference was within 0.7 Gy 
for all relevant OARs. After applying the modifications on the sCT, the average
gamma passing rate was increased to 92.2%. Mean dose difference in PTV D95 and
Dmax were reduced to -0.1% and -0.3% respectively. The mean dose difference was
within 0.2 Gy for all OAR structures and no statistically significant difference 
were found.
CONCLUSIONS: The modified-sCT demonstrated improved dosimetric agreement with the
planning CT. These results indicated the overall dosimetric accuracy and
practicality of this improved MR-based treatment planning method.

The pressing need for SARS-CoV-2 controls has led to a reassessment of strategies
to identify and develop natural product inhibitors of zoonotic, highly virulent, 
and rapidly emerging viruses. This review article addresses how contemporary
approaches involving computational chemistry, natural product (NP) and protein
databases, and mass spectrometry (MS) derived target-ligand interaction analysis 
can be utilized to expedite the interrogation of NP structures while minimizing
the time and expense of extraction, purification, and screening in BioSafety
Laboratories (BSL)3 laboratories. The unparalleled structural diversity and
complexity of NPs is an extraordinary resource for the discovery and development 
of broad-spectrum inhibitors of viral genera, including Betacoronavirus, which
contains MERS, SARS, SARS-CoV-2, and the common cold. There are two key
technological advances that have created unique opportunities for the
identification of NP prototypes with greater efficiency: (1) the application of
structural databases for NPs and target proteins and (2) the application of
modern MS techniques to assess protein-ligand interactions directly from NP
extracts. These approaches, developed over years, now allow for the
identification and isolation of unique antiviral ligands without the immediate
need for BSL3 facilities. Overall, the goal is to improve the success rate of
NP-based screening by focusing resources on source materials with a higher
likelihood of success, while simultaneously providing opportunities for the
discovery of novel ligands to selectively target proteins involved in viral
infection.

In the last decades, the substantial technical progress in radiation oncology
offered the opportunity for more accurate planning and delivery of treatment. At 
the same time, the evolution of systemic treatment and the advent of modern
diagnostic tools allowed for more accurate staging and consequently a safe
reduction of radiotherapy (RT) target volumes and RT doses in the treatment of
lymphomas. As a result, incidental irradiation of organs at risk was reduced,
with a consequent reduction of severe late toxicity in long-term lymphoma
survivors. Nevertheless, these innovations warrant that professionals pay
attention to concurrently ensure precise planning and dose delivery to the target
volume and safe sparing of the organs at risk. In particular, target and organ
motion should be carefully managed in order to prevent any compromise of
treatment efficacy. Several aspects should be taken into account during the
treatment pathway to minimise uncertainties and to apply a valuable motion
management strategy, when needed. These include: reliable image registration
between diagnostic and planning radiologic exams to facilitate the contouring
process, image guidance to limit positioning uncertainties and to ensure the
accuracy of dose delivery and management of lung motion through procedures of
respiratory gating and breath control. In this review, we will cover the current 
clinical approaches to minimise these uncertainties in patients treated with
modern RT techniques, with a particular focus on mediastinal lymphoma. In
addition, since uncertainties have a different impact on the dose deposition of
protons compared to conventional x-rays, the role of motion management and
position verification in proton beam therapy (PBT) will be discussed in a
separate section.

INTRODUCTION: While suicide bombings in the context of warfare have existed
throughout history, there was an exponential rise in such attacks in the decade
following the initiation of the War on Terror. The health care implications of
such attacks are a growing concern across the emergency response sector, and this
study is an epidemiological examination of all terrorism-related bombings
sustained from 1970-2019, comparing the rates of fatal injuries (FI) and
non-fatal injuries (NFI) between suicide bombing attacks (SBA) versus non-suicide
bombing attacks (NSBA).
METHOD: Data collection was performed using a retrospective database search
through the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD database was downloaded and 
searched using the internal database search functions for all events that
occurred from January 1, 1970 - December 31, 2019. Bombing/explosion as a primary
"attack type" and explosives as a primary "weapon type" were selected for the
purpose of this study, and events were further sub-classified as either "suicide 
attack" or "non-suicide attack." Results were exported into an Excel spreadsheet 
(Microsoft Corp.; Redmond, Washington USA) for analysis.
FINDINGS: There were 82,217 bombing/explosion terrorist attacks using explosives 
documented during the study period with 135,807 fatalities and 352,500 NFI.A
total of 5,416 events (6.59% of all events) were sub-classified as SBA causing
52,317 FI (38.52% of all FI) and 107,062 NFI (30.37% of all NFI).Mean SBA FI was 
9.66 per event and mean SBA NFI was 19.77 per event compared to a mean NSBA FI of
1.09 per event and mean NSBA NFI of 3.20 per event.
CONCLUSION: Suicide bombing attacks are a unique terrorist methodology that can
inflict wide-spread psychological damage as well as significantly higher death
and injury tolls when compared to more traditional NSBA. They have been
increasing in popularity amongst terrorist organizations and groups, and
Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) specialists need to be aware of the unique
injury patterns and potential risk mitigation strategies associated with SBA
depending on the target type, location, and gender of the perpetrator.

Tree ring data is of significance for reconstructing climate and predicting
environmental dynamics. In order to accurately measure spacing and other
parameters of Haloxylon ammodendron tree ring, we first assigned coordinate
system to the scanned H. ammodendron disc PS images based on GIS, and then
completed the H. ammodendron tree ring spacing measurement by using ENVI image
classification software and GIS measuring tool. The measurement accuracy was
proved by WinDENDRO tree ring analysis system. The results showed that there was 
no significant difference between those two methods (P=0.63), and that the
difference of paired mean value was 0.87 μm, indicating that the measured results
were accurate and reliable. The constructed method in this study could be used to
measure the spacing of H. ammodendron tree ring, which lay the foundation for the
automatic measurement of tree ring parameters such as area and perimeter. Our
method could replace the current professional tree ring analysis system for some 
ring parameter measurement. The study would contribute to the dendroclimatology
analysis and the investigation on age structure of H. ammodendron population.

The COVID-19 epidemic is spreading day by day. Early diagnosis of this disease is
essential to provide effective preventive and therapeutic measures. This process 
can be used by a computer-aided methodology to improve accuracy. In this study, a
new and optimal method has been utilized for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Here, a
method based on fuzzy C-ordered means (FCOM) along with an improved version of
the enhanced capsule network (ECN) has been proposed for this purpose. The
proposed ECN method is improved based on mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm. The
suggested technique is then implemented on the chest X-ray COVID-19 images from
publicly available datasets. Simulation results are assessed by considering a
comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, including FOMPA, MID, and 4S-DT.
The results show that the proposed method with 97.08% accuracy and 97.29%
precision provides the highest accuracy and reliability compared with the other
studied methods. Moreover, the results show that the proposed method with a 97.1%
sensitivity rate has the highest ratio. And finally, the proposed method with a
97.47% F1-score rate gives the uppermost value compared to the others.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, gun violence (GV) in the
United States (U.S.) was postulated to increase strain on already taxed
healthcare resources, such as blood products, intensive care beds, personal
protective equipment, and even hospital staff. This report aims to estimate the
relative risk of GV in the U.S. during the pandemic compared to before the
pandemic. Daily police reports corresponding to gun-related injuries and deaths
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia from February 1st, 2019, to March
31st, 2021 were obtained from the GV Archive. Generalized linear mixed-effects
models in the form of Poisson regression analysis were utilized to estimate the
state-specific rates of GV. Nationally, GV rates were 30% higher between March
01, 2020, and March 31, 2021 (during the pandemic), compared to the same period
in 2019 (before the pandemic) [intensity ratio (IR) = 1.30; 95% CI 1.29, 1.32;
p < 0.0001]. The risk of GV was significantly higher in 28 states and
significantly lower in only one state. National and state-specific rates of GV
were higher during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same timeframe 1 year
prior. State-specific steps to mitigate violence, or at a minimum adequately
prepare for its toll during the COVID-19 pandemic, should be taken.

Several single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) studies analyzing immune response 
to COVID-19 infection have been recently published. Most of these studies have
small sample sizes, which limits the conclusions that can be made with high
confidence. By re-analyzing these data in a standardized manner, we validated 8
of the 20 published results across multiple datasets. In particular, we found a
consistent decrease in T-cells with increasing COVID-19 infection severity,
upregulation of type I Interferon signal pathways, presence of expanded B-cell
clones in COVID-19 patients but no consistent trend in T-cell clonal expansion.
Overall, our results show that the conclusions drawn from scRNA-seq data analysis
of small cohorts of COVID-19 patients need to be treated with some caution.

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes tens of
million infection world-wide. Many machine learning methods have been proposed
for the computer-aided diagnosis between COVID-19 and community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Most of these methods
utilized the location-specific handcrafted features based on the segmentation
results to improve the diagnose performance. However, the prerequisite
segmentation step is time-consuming and needs the intervention by lots of expert 
radiologists, which cannot be achieved in the areas with limited medical
resources.
METHODS: We propose a generative adversarial feature completion and diagnosis
network (GACDN) that simultaneously generates handcrafted features by radiomic
counterparts and makes accurate diagnoses based on both original and generated
features. Specifically, we first calculate the radiomic features from the CT
images. Then, in order to fast obtain the location-specific handcrafted features,
we use the proposed GACDN to generate them by its corresponding radiomic
features. Finally, we use both radiomic features and location-specific
handcrafted features for COVID-19 diagnosis.
RESULTS: For the performance of our generated location-specific handcrafted
features, the results of four basic classifiers show that it has an average of
3.21% increase in diagnoses accuracy. Besides, the experimental results on
COVID-19 dataset show that our proposed method achieved superior performance in
COVID-19 vs. community acquired pneumonia (CAP) classification compared with the 
state-of-the-art methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method significantly improves the diagnoses accuracy of
COVID-19 vs. CAP in the condition of incomplete location-specific handcrafted
features. Besides, it is also applicable in some regions lacking of expert
radiologists and high-performance computing resources.

Aims: This study aimed to investigate how the psychological health of health care
professionals (HCP) on COVID duty was different from those who were not directly 
in contact. Methodology: Of 473 (76%) randomly selected respondents (doctors and 
nurses) to a WhatsApp request message, 450 subjects' data were finally analyzed. 
Result: The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression among HCP was 33.8, 38.9
and 43.6%, respectively. Compared with nonexposed professionals, COVID-19-exposed
professionals had roughly double the score of these morbidities (t = 6.3, p <
0.001; t = 6.9, p < 0.001; t = 6.0, p < 0.001). Most worry (71.11%) was about the
health of their family, followed by themselves (35.55%). Conclusion: The level of
exposure, feelings of uncertainty and fear of infection emerged in our study as
possible risk factors for psychological morbidities among HCP.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the state-of-the-art for automated
assessment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) from medical image data. However, these
methods lack interpretability, mainly focus on image texture, and cannot
completely grasp the analyzed anatomies' shapes. In this study we assess the
informative value of quantitative features derived from segmentations in order to
assess their potential as an alternative or extension to CNN-based approaches
regarding multiple aspects of KOA. Six anatomical structures around the knee
(femoral and tibial bones, femoral and tibial cartilages, and both menisci) are
segmented in 46,996 MRI scans. Based on these segmentations, quantitative
features are computed, i.e., measurements such as cartilage volume, meniscal
extrusion and tibial coverage, as well as geometric features based on a
statistical shape encoding of the anatomies. The feature quality is assessed by
investigating their association to the Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG), joint space
narrowing (JSN), incident KOA, and total knee replacement (TKR). Using gold
standard labels from the Osteoarthritis Initiative database the balanced accuracy
(BA), the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC), and
weighted kappa statistics are evaluated. Features based on shape encodings of
femur, tibia, and menisci plus the performed measurements showed most potential
as KOA biomarkers. Differentiation between non-arthritic and severely arthritic
knees yielded BAs of up to 99%, 84% were achieved for diagnosis of early KOA.
Weighted kappa values of 0.73, 0.72, and 0.78 were achieved for classification of
the grade of medial JSN, lateral JSN, and KLG, respectively. The AUC was 0.61 and
0.76 for prediction of incident KOA and TKR within one year, respectively.
Quantitative features from automated segmentations provide novel biomarkers for
KLG and JSN classification and show potential for incident KOA and TKR
prediction. The validity of these features should be further evaluated,
especially as extensions of CNN-based approaches. To foster such developments we 
make all segmentations publicly available together with this publication.

BACKGROUND: Perioperative outcomes of children depend on the skill and expertise 
in managing pediatric patients, as well as integration of surgical,
anesthesiology, and medical teams. We compared the types of pediatric patients
and inpatient surgical procedures performed in low- versus higher-volume
hospitals throughout the United States.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 323,258 hospitalizations with an operation for
children age 0 to 17 years in 2857 hospitals included in the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) 2016.
Hospitals were categorized by their volume of annual inpatient surgical
procedures. Specific surgeries were distinguished with the AHRQ Clinical
Classification System. We assessed complex chronic conditions (CCCs) using
Feudtner and Colleagues' system.
RESULTS: The median annual volume of pediatric inpatient surgeries across US
hospitals was 8 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-29). The median volume of inpatient
surgeries for children with a CCC was 4 (IQR, 1-13). Low-volume hospitals
performed significantly fewer types of surgeries (median 2 vs 131 types of
surgeries in hospitals with 1-24 vs ≥2000 volumes). Appendectomy and fixation of 
bone fracture were among the most common surgeries in low-volume hospitals. As
the volume of surgical procedures increased from 1 to 24 to ≥2000, the percentage
of older children ages 11 to 17 years decreased (70.9%-32.0% [P < .001]) and the 
percentage of children with a CCC increased (11.2%-60.0% [P < .001]).
CONCLUSIONS: Thousands of US hospitals performed inpatient surgeries on few
pediatric patients, including those with CCCs who have the highest risk of
perioperative morbidity and mortality. Evaluation of perioperative decision
making, workflows, and pediatric clinicians in low- and higher-volume hospitals
is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: The first objective was to identify a method for early prediction of
independent outdoor functional walking 1 yr after a traumatic spinal cord injury 
using the motor and sensory function derived from the International Standards for
Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury assessment during acute care.
Then, the second objective was to develop a clinically relevant prediction rule
that would be accurate, easy to use, and quickly calculated in clinical setting.
DESIGN: A prospective cohort of 159 traumatic spinal cord injury patients was
analyzed. Bivariate correlations were used to determine the assessment method of 
motor strength and sensory function as well as the specific dermatomes and
myotomes best associated with independent outdoor functional walking 1 yr after
injury. An easy-to-use clinical prediction rule was produced using a
multivariable linear regression model.
RESULTS: The highest motor strength for a given myotome (L3 and L5) and preserved
light touch sensation (dermatome S1) were the best predictors of the outcome. The
proposed prediction rule displayed a sensitivity of 84.21%, a specificity of
85.54%, and a global accuracy of 84.91% for classification.
CONCLUSIONS: After an acute traumatic spinal cord injury, accurately predicting
the ability to walk is challenging. The proposed clinical prediction rule aims to
enhance previous work by identifying traumatic spinal cord injury patients who
will reach a mobility level that fosters social participation and quality of life
in the chronic period after the injury.

The near-miss events involving vulnerable road users can lead to serious
accidents. Safe and careful expert drivers perform a hazard-anticipatory driving 
and they will naturally seek to reduce the uncertainty by attempting to fit their
current driving context into a pre-existing category they have already developed,
that is, predicting what can happen. In this study, our target situation consists
of a cyclist attempting a road crossing at a blind spot. This study aims at
developing a context-aware driver model for determining the recommended driving
speed at blind intersections based on the analysis of near-miss-incidence
database, which includes the data on driver behavior and road environmental
factors just before the near-miss. First, we extracted the drive-recorder data
using the management tool provided in the database. Second, risk, which is
defined as the time margin for drivers to perform evasive actions to avoid a
crash, was quantified for the extracted data using the safety-cushion time. The
safety-cushion time can be observed as a result of the driver's adjustment to the
vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment. One of the key aspects 
in developing the context-aware driver model is to categorize the extracted
near-miss data into two levels based on the risk quantifications: low- and
high-risk events. The low- and high-risk events were regarded as a result of the 
driver's appropriate adjustment of, and inability or failure to adjust the
vehicle velocity depending on the given road environment, respectively. Third,
based on a multiple linear regression analysis with low-risk event dataset, we
constructed a context-aware driver model to produce the recommended vehicle speed
depending on the given road environment. The road environment variables,
determined by stepwise regression, were identified as factors that reduced or
increased the vehicle velocity at blind intersections, and were incorporated into
the model as predictors. Furthermore, we quantitatively visualized drivers
setting the baseline for speed adjustment and increasing or decreasing the speed 
according to the given road environment context. Fourth, the model validation
demonstrated a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.20, and a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 6.54 km/h on average in the 5-fold cross-validation. Finally, to
investigate the effectiveness of the constructed driver model on safety
performance, we used the dataset of high-risk events as test data. Theoretically,
the constructed driver model guided the drivers to drive the vehicle at the
recommended speed, and thus convert more than half of the high-risk events into
low-risk events. These results indicate that the context-aware driver model is
feasible to be used to adjust the approaching speed at blind intersections in
accordance with the road environment factors.

PURPOSE: Many quantitative metrics have been proposed in literature for
characterization of spatial dose properties. The aim of this study is to work
towards much-needed consensus in the radiotherapy community on which of these
metrics to use. We do this by comparing characteristics of the metrics and
providing a systematically selected set of metrics to comprehensively quantify
properties of the spatial dose distribution.
METHODS: We searched the literature for metrics to quantitatively evaluate dose
conformity, homogeneity, gradient (overall and directional), and distribution and
location of over- and under-dosed sub-volumes. For each spatial dose property, we
compared the responses of its corresponding metrics to simulated dose variations 
in a virtual water phantom. Selection criteria were a metric's ability to
describe simulated scenarios robustly and to be visualized in an intuitive way.
RESULTS: We saw substantial differences in the responses of metrics to the
simulated dose variations. Some conformity and homogeneity metrics were unable to
quantify certain types of changes (e.g. target under-coverage). Others showed a
large dependency on the shape and volume of targets and isodoses. Metric values
differed between calculations in a static plan and in simulated full treatment
courses including setup errors, especially for metrics quantifying distribution
and location of hot and cold spots. We provide an Eclipse plugin script to
calculate and visualize selected metrics.
CONCLUSION: The selected set of metrics provides complementary and comprehensive 
quantitative information about the spatial dose distribution. This work serves as
a step towards broader consensus on the use of spatial dose metrics.

OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest superior outcomes with use of intravenous (IV)
balanced fluids compared to normal saline (NS). However, significant fluid
prescribing variability persists, highlighting the knowledge-to-practice gap. We 
sought to identify contributors to prescribing variation and utilize a clinical
decision support system (CDSS) to increase institutional balanced fluid
prescribing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center informatics-enabled quality improvement
initiative for patients hospitalized or treated in the emergency department
included stepwise interventions of 1) identification of design factors within the
computerized provider order entry (CPOE) of our electronic health record (EHR)
that contribute to preferential NS ordering, 2) clinician education, 3) fluid
stocking modifications, 4) re-design and implementation of a CDSS-integrated IV
fluid ordering panel, and 5) comparison of fluid prescribing before and after the
intervention. EHR-derived prescribing data was analyzed via single interrupted
time series.
RESULTS: Pre-intervention (3/2019-9/2019), balanced fluids comprised 33% of
isotonic fluid orders, with gradual uptake (1.4%/month) of balanced fluid
prescribing. Clinician education (10/2019-2/2020) yielded a modest (4.4%/month,
95% CI 1.6-7.2, p = 0.01) proportional increase in balanced fluid prescribing,
while CPOE redesign (3/2020) yielded an immediate (20.7%, 95% CI 17.7-23.6,
p < 0.0001) and sustained increase (72% of fluid orders in 12/2020). The
intervention proved most effective among those with lower baseline balanced
fluids utilization, including emergency medicine (57% increase, 95% CI 0.7-1.8,
p < 0.0001) and internal medicine/subspecialties (18% increase, 95% CI 14.4-21.3,
p < 0.0001) clinicians and substantially reduced institutional prescribing
variation.
CONCLUSION: Integration of CDSS into an EHR yielded a robust and sustained
increase in balanced fluid prescribing. This impact far exceeded that of
clinician education highlighting the importance of CDSS.

Considering spatial accessibility of health services is a critical part in the
planning and management of health services. There is evidence that poor
geographical locations can obstruct prompt basic health care services to some
population sections. We developed a location-allocation P-median model for health
centres after analysing their sites, demand location of health services and the
road network in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This model attempts to optimize health care
services network and to put forward location recommendations to maximise service 
coverage. Our model is shown to be useful as it provides a robust evidence base
to urban planners and policymakers responsible for making spatial decisions for
the development of the health sector. Besides, it follows the paradigm of new
urbanism that encourages decentralisation of essential facilities including basic
healthcare in cities, where emphasis is on offering all basic services within
walkable distances of 15 min. or less.

Medicinal plants are increasingly used, both for medical applications and
personal healthcare. However, existing herbal database systems for plant
retrieval offer only basic information and do not support real-time analysis of
the spatial aspects of plantations and distribution sites. Moreover, data records
are usually static and not publicly available as they rely on costly proprietary 
software packages. To address these shortcomings, including limiting the time
needed for collection and data processing, a novel medicinal plants geospatial
database management system is proposed. The system allows localization of plant
sites and data presentation on an interactive heat map displaying spatial
information of plants selected by the user within a specific radius from the
user's location, including automatic presentation of an itinerary giving the
optimal route between user location and plant destinations selected. The approach
relies on dynamic and role-based data management, an interactive map that
includes graphics and integrated geospatial analyses thanks to cross-platform,
geographical a JavaScript library and Google API. Both spatial data and

collaboration, among herb farmers, government agencies, private investors,

In the last few decades, public health surveillance has increasingly applied
statistical methods to analyze the spatial disease distributions. Nevertheless,
contact tracing and follow up control measures for tuberculosis (TB) patients
remain challenging because public health officers often lack the programming
skills needed to utilize the software appropriately. This study aimed to develop 
a more user-friendly application by applying the CodeIgniter framework for server
development, ArcGIS JavaScript for data display and a web application based on
JavaScript and Hypertext Preprocessor to build the server's interface, while a
webGIS technology was used for mapping. The performance of this approach was
tested based on 3325 TB cases and their sociodemographic data, such as age,
gender, race, nationality, country of origin, educational level, employment
status, health care worker status, income status, residency status, and smoking
status between 1st January 2013 and 31st December 2017 in Gombak, Selangor,
Malaysia. These data were collected from the Gombak District Health Office and
Rawang Health Clinic. Latitude and longitude of the location for each case was
geocoded by uploading spatial data using Google Earth and the main output was an 
interactive map displaying location of each case. Filters are available for the
selection of the various sociodemographic factors of interest. The application
developed should assist public health experts to utilize spatial data for the
surveillance purposes comprehensively as well as for the drafting of regulations 
aimed at to reducing mortality and morbidity and thus minimizing the public
health impact of the disease.

Validation of the Chieti Affective Action Videos (CAAV) database was replicated
with a sample of older adults (age range 65-93). When designing experimental
studies of emotions, it is crucial to take into consideration the differences in 
emotional processing between young and older adults. Therefore, the main goal of 
the present study was to provide an appropriate dataset for the use of CAAV in
aging research. For this reason, the CAAV administration and the data collection 
methodology was faithfully replicated in a sample of 302 older adults. All the
360 standardized stimuli were evaluated on the emotional dimensions of valence
and arousal. The CAAV validation in an older adults' population increases the
potential use of this innovative tool. The present validation supports the use of
the CAAV database in future experimental studies on cognitive functions in
healthy and pathological aging.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to measure trends in evaluation and management of children
with simple febrile seizures (SFSs) before and after the American Academy of
Pediatrics updated guidelines published in 2011.
METHODS: In this retrospective, cross-sectional analysis, we used the Pediatric
Health Information System database comprising 49 tertiary care pediatric
hospitals in the United States from 2005 to 2019. We included children aged 6 to 
60 months with an emergency department visit for first SFS identified using codes
from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and
International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision.
RESULTS: We identified 142 121 children (median age 21 months, 42.4% female) with
an emergency department visit for SFS. A total of 49 668 (35.0%) children
presented before and 92 453 (65.1%) after the guideline. The rate of lumbar
puncture for all ages declined from 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8% to
12.4%) in 2005 to 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5% to 0.8%) in 2019 (P < .001). Similar
reductions were noted in rates of head computed tomography (10.6% to 1.6%; P <
.001), complete blood cell count (38.8% to 10.9%; P < .001), hospital admission
(19.2% to 5.2%; P < .001), and mean costs ($1523 to $601; P < .001). Reductions
in all outcomes began before, and continued after, the publication of the
American Academy of Pediatrics guideline. There was no significant change in
delayed diagnosis of bacterial meningitis (preperiod 2 of 49 668 [0.0040%; 95%
CI, 0.00049% to 0.015%], postperiod 3 of 92 453 [0.0032%; 95% CI, 0.00066% to
0.0094%]; P = .99).
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic testing, hospital admission, and costs decreased over the
study period, without a concomitant increase in delayed diagnosis of bacterial
meningitis. These data suggest most children with SFSs can be safely managed
without lumber puncture or other diagnostic testing.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality of studies on prediction models
developed using machine learning techniques across all medical specialties.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles reporting on the development, with or without
external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or
prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised
predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted 
patient related health outcomes.
REVIEW METHODS: Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of 
bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This 
tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in
four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants,
predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall).
RESULTS: 152 studies were included: 58 (38%) included a diagnostic prediction
model and 94 (62%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152
developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87%,
95% confidence interval 81% to 91%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis
domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85
(56%, 48% to 64%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per
candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41%, 33% to 49%), and 
59 assessed overfitting improperly (39%, 31% to 47%). Most models used
appropriate data sources to develop (73%, 66% to 79%) and externally validate the
machine learning based prediction models (74%, 51% to 88%). Information about
blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40%,
32% to 47%) and 79 (52%, 44% to 60%) of the developed models, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor
methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk
of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to
deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and
validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine
learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: To describe an automated method for assessment of the plausibility of
continuous variables collected in the electronic health record (EHR) data for
real world evidence research use.
METHODS: The most widely used approach in quality assessment (QA) for continuous 
variables is to detect the implausible numbers using prespecified thresholds. In 
augmentation to the thresholding method, we developed a score-based method that
leverages the longitudinal characteristics of EHR data for detection of the
observations inconsistent with the history of a patient. The method was applied
to the height and weight data in the EHR from the Million Veteran Program Data
from the Veteran's Healthcare Administration (VHA). A validation study was also
conducted.
RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) metrics of the developed
method outperforms the widely used thresholding method. It is also demonstrated
that different quality assessment methods have a non-ignorable impact on the body
mass index (BMI) classification calculated from height and weight data in the
VHA's database.
CONCLUSIONS: The score-based method enables automated and scaled detection of the
problematic data points in health care big data while allowing the investigators 
to select the high-quality data based on their need. Leveraging the longitudinal 
characteristics in EHR will significantly improve the QA performance.

BACKGROUND: Research is often undertaken using patient-reported outcomes from
questionnaires. Achieving a high response rate demands expensive and
time-consuming methods like telephone reminders. However, it is unknown whether
telephone reminders change outcome estimates or only affect the response rate in 
research of populations with low back pain (LBP). The aim is to compare baseline 
characteristics and the change in outcome between patients responding before and 
after receiving a telephone reminder.
METHODS: This is an ancillary analysis of data from a prospective cohort study
employing questionnaires from 812 adults with LBP lasting more than 3 months.
Patients not responding to the 52-week questionnaire were sent reminder emails
after two and 3 weeks and delivered postal reminders after 4 weeks. Patients
still not responding were contacted by telephone, with a maximum of two attempts.
Patients were categorised into three groups: 1) patients responding before a
telephone reminder was performed; 2) patients responding after the telephone
reminder and 3) patients not responding at all. A positive outcome was defined as
a 30% improvement on the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire after 52 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 695 patients (85.2%) responded. Of these, 643 patients were
classified in Group 1 and 52 patients were classified in Group 2. One hundred
seventeen were classified in Group 3. No differences in outcome or baseline
characteristics was found. In Group 1, 41.3% had a positive outcome, and in Group
2 48.9% had a positive outcome (P = 0.297). In group 3, non-respondents were
younger, more often unemployed, more often smokers, more often reported
co-morbidity, and reported higher depression scores than respondents.
CONCLUSIONS: Using a telephone reminder had no consequence on outcome estimates
nor were there any differences in baseline characteristics between patients who
responded before or after the telephone reminder.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The initial trial was registered in Clinicaltrials.gov (
NCT03058315 ).

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Deep learning algorithms show revolutionary potential 
in computer-aided diagnosis. These computer-aided diagnosis techniques often rely
on large-scale, balanced standard datasets. However, there are many rare diseases
in real clinical scenarios, which makes the medical datasets present a highly
imbalanced long-tailed distribution, leading to the poor generalization ability
of deep learning models. Currently, most algorithms to solve this problem involve
more complex modules and loss functions. But for complicated tasks in the medical
domain, usually suffer from issues such as increased inference time and unstable 
performance. Therefore, it is a great challenge to develop a computer-aided
diagnosis algorithm for long-tailed medical data.
METHODS: We proposed the Multi-Branch Network based on Memory Features (MBNM) for
Long-Tailed Medical Image Recognition. MBNM includes three branches, where each
branch focuses on a different learning task: 1) the regular learning branch
learns the generalizable feature representations; 2) the tail learning branch
gains extra intra-class diversity for the tail classes through the feature memory
module and the improved reverse sampler to improve the classification performance
of the tail classes; 3) the fusion balance branch integrates various
decision-making advantages and introduces an adaptive loss function to re-balance
the classification performance of easy and difficult samples.
RESULTS: We conducted experiments on the multi-disease Ophthalmic OCT datasets
with imbalance factors of 98.48 and skin image datasets Skin-7 with imbalance
factors of 58.3. The Accuracy, MCR, F1-Score, Precision, and AUC of our model
were significantly improved over the strong baselines in the auxiliary diagnosis 
scenario where the clinical medical data is extremely imbalanced. Furthermore, we
demonstrated that MBNM outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the publicly
available natural image datasets (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm can solve the problem of imbalanced data
distribution with little added cost. In addition, the memory module does not act 
in the inference phase, thereby saving inference time. And it shows outstanding
performance on medical images and natural images with a variety of imbalance
factors.

BACKGROUND: The creation of a computerized clinical database with the ability to 
collect prospective information from patients and with the possibility of rescue 
and crossing data enables scientific studies of higher quality and credibility in
less time.
AIM: To validate, in a single master protocol, the clinical data referring to
Surgery of Digestive System in a multidisciplinary way, incorporating in the
SINPE© platform, and to verify the incidence of digestive diseases based on the
prospectively performed collections.
METHOD: Organize in one software, in a standardized structure, all the
pre-existing items in the SINPE© database; the theoretical basis was computerized
through the MIGRASINPE© module creating a single multiprofessional master
protocol for use as a whole.
RESULTS: The existing specific protocols were created and/or adapted - they
correspond to the most prevalent digestive diseases - unifying them. The
possibility of multiprofessional use was created by integrating all data
collected from medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, nutrition and health management 
in a prospective way. The total was 4,281 collections, distributed as follows:
extrahepatic biliary tract, n=1,786; esophagus, n=1015; anorectal, n=736; colon, 
n=550; small intestine, n=86; pancreas, n=71; stomach, n=23; liver, n=14.
CONCLUSIONS: The validation of the unification and structuring in a single master
protocol of the clinical data referring to the Surgery of the Digestive System in
a multiprofessional and prospective way was possible and the epidemiological
study carried out allowed to identify the most prevalent digestive diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to perform dosimetric analysis of
radiotherapy (RT) plans with or without elective nodal irradiation (ENI) and
estimate whether the increase in mean doses (MDs) in the heart and lungs with ENI
may lead to late side effects that may surpass the benefits of treatment.
METHODS: The dosimetric analysis of 30 treatment plans was done with or without
ENI. The planning and dose-volume histograms were analyzed, and the impact on the
mortality of cardiovascular and lung cancer was estimated based on the
correlation of the dosimetric data with data from population studies.
RESULTS: RT with ENI increased the doses in the lungs and heterogeneity in the
plans compared to breast-exclusive RT. When the increase in MDs is correlated
with the increase of late side-effect risks, the most important effect of ENI is 
the increased risk of lung cancer, especially in patients who smoke (average
increase in absolute risk=1.38%). The increase in the absolute risk of
cardiovascular diseases was below 0.1% in the all the situations analyzed.
CONCLUSIONS: ENI increases the heterogeneity and the doses at the lungs. When
recommending ENI, the risks and benefits must be taken into account, considering 
the oncology factors and the plan of each patient. Special attention must be
given to patients who smoke as ENI may lead to a significant increase in MD in
the lung and the increased risk of radiation-induced lung cancer may surpass the 
benefits from this treatment.

BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a leading cause of death among children under five
years. Previous estimates indicated global preterm birth rate of 10.6% (14.8
million neonates) in 2014. We aim to update preterm birth estimates at global,
regional, and national levels for the period 2010 to 2019.
METHODS: Preterm birth is defined as a live birth occurring before 37 completed
gestational weeks, or <259 days since a woman's last menstrual period. National
administrative data sources for WHO Member States with facility birth rates of
≥80% in the most recent year for which data is available will be searched.
Administrative data identified for these countries will be considered if ≥80% of 
UN estimated live births include gestational age information to define preterm
birth. For countries without eligible administrative data, a systematic review of
studies will be conducted. Research studies will be eligible if the reported
outcome is derived from an observational or intervention study conducted at
national or sub-national level in population- or facility-based settings. Risk of
bias assessments will focus on gestational age measurement method and coverage,
and inclusion of special subgroups in published estimates. Covariates for
inclusion will be selected a priori based on a conceptual framework of plausible 
associations with preterm birth, data availability, and quality of covariate data
across many countries and years. Global, regional and national preterm birth
rates will be estimated using a Bayesian multilevel-mixed regression model.
DISCUSSION: Accurate measurement of preterm birth is challenging in many
countries given incomplete or unavailable data from national administrative
sources, compounded by limited gestational age assessment during pregnancy to
define preterm birth. Up-to-date modelled estimates will be an important resource
to measure the global burden of preterm birth and to inform policies and programs
especially in settings with a high burden of neonatal mortality.

High accuracy has been reported in deep learning classification for amyloid brain
scans, an important factor in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, the
possibility of overfitting should be considered, as this model is fitted with
sample data. Therefore, we created and evaluated an [18F]Florbetaben amyloid
brain positron emission tomography (PET) scan classification model with a Dong-A 
University Hospital (DAUH) dataset based on a convolutional neural network (CNN),
and performed external validation with the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative dataset. Spatial normalization, count normalization, and skull
stripping preprocessing were performed on the DAUH and external datasets.
However, smoothing was only performed on the external dataset. Three types of
models were used, depending on their structure: Inception3D, ResNet3D, and VGG3D.
After training with 80% of the DAUH dataset, an appropriate model was selected,
and the rest of the DAUH dataset was used for model evaluation. The
generalization potential of the selected model was then validated using the
external dataset. The accuracy of the model evaluation for Inception3D, ResNet3D,
and VGG3D was 95.4%, 92.0%, and 97.7%, and the accuracy of the external
validation was 76.7%, 67.1%, and 85.3%, respectively. Inception3D and ResNet3D
were retrained with the external dataset; then, the area under the curve was
compared to determine the binary classification performance with a significance
level of less than 0.05. When external validation was performed again after fine 
tuning, the performance improved to 15.3%p for Inception3D and 16.9%p for
ResNet3D. In [18F]Florbetaben amyloid brain PET scan classification using CNN,
the generalization potential can be seen through external validation. When there 
is a significant difference between the model classification performance and the 
external validation, changing the model structure or fine tuning the model can
help improve the classification performance, and the optimal model can also be
found by collaborating through a web-based open platform.

A new methodology for classifying fragment combinations and characterizing
pseudonatural products (PNPs) is described. The source code is based on
open-source tools and is organized as a Python package. Tasks can be executed
individually or within the context of scalable, robust workflows. First,
structures are standardized and duplicate entries are filtered out. Then,
molecules are probed for the presence of predefined fragments. For molecules with
more than one match, fragment combinations are classified. The algorithm
considers the pairwise relative position of fragments within the molecule (fused 
atoms, linkers, intermediary rings), resulting in 18 different possible fragment 
combination categories. Finally, all combinations for a given molecule are
assembled into a fragment combination graph, with fragments as nodes and
combination types as edges. This workflow was applied to characterize PNPs in the
ChEMBL database via comparison of fragment combination graphs with natural
product (NP) references, represented by the Dictionary of Natural Products. The
Murcko fragments extracted from 2000 structures previously described were used to
define NP fragments. The results indicate that ca. 23% of the biologically
relevant compounds listed in ChEMBL comply to the PNP definition and that,
therefore, PNPs occur frequently among known biologically relevant small
molecules. The majority (>95%) of PNPs contain two to four fragments, mainly
(>95%) distributed in five different combination types. These findings may
provide guidance for the design of new PNPs.

Non-parametric survival analysis has become a very popular statistical method in 
current medical research. However, resorting to survival analysis when its
fundamental assumptions are not fulfilled can severely bias the results.
Currently, hundreds of clinical studies are using survival methods to investigate
factors potentially associated with the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) and test new preventive and therapeutic strategies. In the pandemic
era, it is more critical than ever to base decision-making on evidence and rely
on solid statistical methods, but this is not always the case. Serious
methodological errors have been identified in recent seminal studies about
COVID-19: One reporting outcomes of patients treated with remdesivir and another 
one on the epidemiology, clinical course, and outcomes of critically ill
patients. High-quality evidence is essential to inform clinicians about optimal
COVID-19 therapies and policymakers about the true effect of preventive measures 
aiming to tackle the pandemic. Though timely evidence is needed, we should
encourage the appropriate application of survival analysis methods and careful
peer-review to avoid publishing flawed results, which could affect
decision-making. In this paper, we recapitulate the basic assumptions underlying 
non-parametric survival analysis and frequent errors in its application and
discuss how to handle data on COVID-19.

Publisher: El análisis de supervivencia no paramétrico se ha convertido en un

de decisiones en pruebas y confiar en métodos estadísticos sólidos, pero no
siempre es así. Se han identificado errores metodológicos graves en estudios
seminales recientes sobre COVID-19: uno que informa los resultados de los
pacientes tratados con remdesivir y otro sobre la epidemiología, el curso clínico
y los resultados de los pacientes en estado crítico. La evidencia de alta calidad
es esencial para informar a los médicos sobre las terapias COVID-19 óptimas y a
los legisladores sobre el verdadero efecto de las medidas preventivas destinadas 
a abordar la pandemia. Aunque se necesita evidencia oportuna, debemos fomentar la
aplicación adecuada de métodos de análisis de supervivencia y una revisión
cuidadosa por pares para evitar la publicación de resultados defectuosos, que
podrían afectar la toma de decisiones. En este artículo, recapitulamos los
supuestos básicos que subyacen al análisis de supervivencia no paramétrico y los 
errores frecuentes en su aplicación y discutimos cómo manejar los datos sobre
COVID-19.

Waste charging policy is one of the tools used by many countries to solve waste
management problems. Before a policy can be fully implemented, it is important to
study residents' willingness to pay (WTP) for waste disposal and estimate its
effectiveness. This study aims to use data mining models to predict the maximum
WTP amount and ratio estimation method to estimate the effectiveness of the
proposed waste charging policy in Hong Kong. The results show that the average
value of the predicted maximum willingness to pay (WTP) amount varies between
HK$36.75 and HK$39.99 based on the data mining models. According to the decision 
tree models, the predicted maximum WTP amount of the respondents in the training 
dataset varies between HK$11.3 and HK$94.6. At least 8% of the residents may not 
afford to pay for waste disposal and need help. At least 5% of the respondents
may well afford to pay and may not be motivated by the waste charging policy to
reduce waste. It is plausible that over 53% of the respondents may accept the
waste charging policy. Assuming the residents will reduce waste to keep the waste
disposal expenditure within their maximum WTP amount, the percentage of waste
reduction is estimated to be around 12.56-28.12% under the price level of HK$0.11
per liter. The findings may be helpful to the related parties to design and
implement the waste charging policy.

OBJECTIVE: Mortality rates for patients with SLE have not been reported in
Australia. This study determined the association between a hospitalisation for
SLE with mortality.
METHODS: Population-level cohort study of patients with SLE (n=2112; 25 710
person-years) and general population comparators (controls) (n=21, 120; 280 637
person-years) identified from hospital records contained within the WA Rheumatic 
Disease Epidemiological Registry from 1980 to 2013. SLE was identified by
ICD-9-CM: 695.4, 710.0, ICD-10-AM: L93.0, M32.0. Controls were nearest matched
(10:1) for age, sex, Aboriginality and temporality. Using longitudinal linked
health data, we assessed the association between a hospitalisation for SLE
mortality and mortality with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards
and competing risks regression models.
RESULTS: At timezero, patients with SLE were similar in age (43.96 years), with
higher representation of females (85.1% vs 83.4%, p=0.038), Aboriginal
Australians (7.8% vs 6.0%) and smokers (20.5% vs 13.2%). Before study entry,
patients with SLE (mean lookback 9 years) had higher comorbidity accrual
(Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥1 item (42.0% vs 20.5%)), especially cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) (44.7% vs 21.0%) and nephritis (16.4% vs 0.5%), all p<0.001. During
follow-up (mean 12.5 years), 548 (26.0%) patients with SLE and 2450 (11.6%)
comparators died. A hospitalisation for SLE increased the unadjusted (HR 2.42,
95% CI 2.20 to 2.65) and multivariate-adjusted risk of mortality (aHR 2.03,
95% CI 1.84 to 2.23), which reduced from 1980 to 1999 (aHR 1.42) to 2000-2014
(aHR 1.27). Females (aHR 2.11), Aboriginal Australians (aHR 3.32),
socioeconomically disadvantaged (aHR 2.49), and those <40 years old (aHR 7.46)
were most vulnerable. At death, patients with SLE had a higher burden of
infection (aHR 4.38), CVD (aHR 2.09) and renal disease (aHR 3.43), all p<0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: A hospitalisation for SLE associated with an increased risk of
mortality over the 1980-2014 period compared with the general population. The
risk was especially high in younger (<40 years old), socioeconomically
disadvantaged and Aboriginal Australians.

OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to describe differences or similarities in the scope,
participant characteristics and methods used in core outcome sets (COS)
development when only participants from high-income countries (HICs) were
involved compared with when participants from low-income and middle-income
countries (LMICs) were also involved.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: Annual Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials systematic
reviews of COS which are updated based on SCOPUS and MEDLINE, searches. The
latest systematic review included studies published up to the end of 2019.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included studies reporting
development of a COS for use in research regardless of age, health condition or
setting. Studies reporting the development of a COS for patient-reported outcomes
or adverse events or complications were also included.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted in relation to scope of the
COS study, participant categories and the methods used in outcome selection.
RESULTS: Studies describing 370 COS were identified in the database. Of these, 75
(20%) included participants from LMICs. Only four COS were initiated from an LMIC
setting. More than half of COS with LMIC participants were developed in the last 
5 years. Cancer and rheumatology were the dominant disease domains. Overall, over
259 (70%) of COS explicitly reported including clinical experts; this was higher 
where LMIC participants were also included 340 (92%). Most LMIC participants were
from China, Brazil and South Africa. Mixed methods for consensus building were
used across the two settings.
CONCLUSION: Progress has been made in including LMIC participants in the
development of COS, however, there is a need to explore how to enable initiation 
of COS development from a range of LMIC settings, how to ensure prioritisation of
COS that better reflects the burden of disease in these contexts and how to
improve public participation from LMICs.

BACKGROUND: Despite the improvements in the knowledge and understanding of the
role of health information in the global health system, the quality of data
generated by a routine health information system is still very poor in low and
middle-income countries. There is a paucity of studies as to what determines data
quality in health facilities in the study area. Therefore, this study was aimed
to assess the quality of routine health information system data and associated
factors in public health facilities of Harari region, Ethiopia.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in all public health facilities in
the Harari region of Ethiopia. The department-level data were collected from
respective department heads through document reviews, interviews, and observation
checklists. Descriptive statistics were used to data quality and multivariate
logistic regression was run to identify factors influencing data quality. The
level of significance was declared at P value < 0.05.
RESULT: The study found good quality data in 51.35% (95% CI 44.6-58.1) of the
departments in public health facilities in the Harari Region. Departments found
in the health centers were 2.5 times more likely to have good quality data as
compared to those found in the health posts. The presence of trained staffs able 
to fill reporting formats (AOR = 2.474; 95% CI 1.124-5.445) and provisions of
feedbacks (AOR = 3.083; 95% CI 1.549-6.135) were also significantly associated
with data quality.
CONCLUSION: The level of good data quality in the public health facilities was
less than the expected national level. Lack of trained personnel able to fill the
reporting format and feedback were the factors that are found to be affecting
data quality. Therefore, training should be provided to increase the knowledge
and skills of the health workers. Regular supportive supervision and feedback
should also be maintained.

BACKGROUND: Data to better understand and manage the COVID-19 pandemic is
urgently needed. However, there are gaps in information stored within even the
best routinely-collected electronic health records (EHR) including test results, 
remote consultations for suspected COVID-19, shielding, physical activity, mental
health, and undiagnosed or untested COVID-19 patients. Observational and
Pragmatic Research Institute (OPRI) Singapore and Optimum Patient Care (OPC) UK
established Platform C19, a research database combining EHR data and bespoke
patient questionnaire. We describe the demographics, clinical characteristics,
patient behavior, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using data within Platform 
C19.
METHODS: EHR data from Platform C19 were extracted from 14 practices across UK
participating in the OPC COVID-19 Quality Improvement program on a continuous,
monthly basis. Starting 7th August 2020, consenting patients aged 18-85 years
were invited in waves to fill an online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics
were summarized using all data available up to 22nd January 2021.
FINDINGS: From 129,978 invitees, 31,033 responded. Respondents were predominantly
female (59.6%), white (93.5%), and current or ex-smokers (52.6%). Testing for
COVID-19 was received by 23.8% of respondents, of which 7.9% received positive
results. COVID-19 symptoms lasted ≥4 weeks in 19.5% of COVID-19 positive
respondents. Up to 39% respondents reported a negative impact on questions
regarding their mental health. Most (67%-76%) respondents with asthma, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diabetes, heart, or kidney disease reported
no change in the condition of their diseases.
INTERPRETATION: Platform C19 will enable research on key questions relating to
COVID-19 pandemic not possible using EHR data alone.

Sri Lanka is an amphibian hotspot of global significance. Its anuran fauna is
dominated by the shrub frogs of the genus Pseudophilautus. Except for one small
clade of four species in Peninsular India, these cool-wet adapted frogs,
numbering some 59 extant species, are distributed mainly across the montane and
lowland rain forests of the island. With species described primarily by
morphological means, the diversification has never yet been subjected to a
molecular species delimitation analysis, a procedure now routinely applied in
taxonomy. Here we test the species boundaries of Pseudophilautus in the context
of the phylogenetic species concept (PSC). We use all the putative species for
which credible molecular data are available (nDNA-Rag-1; mt-DNA- 12S rRNA, 16S
rRNA) to build a well resolved phylogeny, which is subjected to species
delimitation analyses. The ABGD, bPTP, mPTP and bGMYC species delimitation
methods applied to the 16S rRNA frog barcoding gene (for all species), 12S rRNA
and Rag-1 nDNA grouped P. procax and P. abundus; P. hallidayi and P.
fergusonianus; P. reticulatus and P. pappilosus; P. pleurotaenia and P.
hoipolloi; P. hoffmani and P. asankai; P. silvaticus and P. limbus; P. dilmah and
P. hankeni; P. fulvus and P. silus.. Surprisingly, all analyses recovered 14
unidentified potential new species as well. The geophylogeny affirms a
distribution across the island's aseasonal 'wet zone' and its three principal
hill ranges, suggestive of allopatric speciation playing a dominant role,
especially between mountain masses. Among the species that are merged by the
delimitation analyses, a pattern leading towards a model of parapatric speciation
emerges-ongoing speciation in the presence of gene flow. This delimitation
analysis reinforces the species hypotheses, paving the way to a reasonable
understanding of Sri Lankan Pseudophilautus, enabling both deeper analyses and
conservation efforts of this remarkable diversification.

Pain assessment in horses using automatic facial expression recognition through
deep learning-based modeling.

The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine vision algorithm to
assess the pain level in horses, using an automatic computational classifier
based on the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) and trained by machine learning method.
The use of the Horse Grimace Scale is dependent on a human observer, who most of 
the time does not have availability to evaluate the animal for long periods and
must also be well trained in order to apply the evaluation system correctly. In
addition, even with adequate training, the presence of an unknown person near an 
animal in pain can result in behavioral changes, making the evaluation more
complex. As a possible solution, the automatic video-imaging system will be able 
to monitor pain responses in horses more accurately and in real-time, and thus
allow an earlier diagnosis and more efficient treatment for the affected animals.
This study is based on assessment of facial expressions of 7 horses that
underwent castration, collected through a video system positioned on the top of
the feeder station, capturing images at 4 distinct timepoints daily for two days 
before and four days after surgical castration. A labeling process was applied to
build a pain facial image database and machine learning methods were used to
train the computational pain classifier. The machine vision algorithm was
developed through the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
resulted in an overall accuracy of 75.8% while classifying pain on three levels: 
not present, moderately present, and obviously present. While classifying between
two categories (pain not present and pain present) the overall accuracy reached
88.3%. Although there are some improvements to be made in order to use the system
in a daily routine, the model appears promising and capable of measuring pain on 
images of horses automatically through facial expressions, collected from video
images.

PURPOSE: To determine the impact of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron
emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) on clinical management in
patients with suspected mycotic aortic aneurysms (MAA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this observational cohort study 101 PET/CT were
acquired in 50 patients, thereof 50 for the initial diagnosis/baseline scan, 51
for follow-up. Impact on patient management was defined in three categories:
PET/CT results were "confirmed" (by clinical follow-up), "suspected" (conclusive,
not confirmed), or "misleading" (proven wrong by follow-up). For clinical
follow-up patient data were recorded at the time of imaging, and at the latest
recorded clinical visit. It included patient demographics, clinical information, 
laboratory data, results of microbiology and other diagnostic procedures,
information about treatment, and patient's general health condition.
RESULTS: In four patients (8%) no clinical follow-up was feasible, the other 46
patients were clinically followed for a median of 898 days (IQR 320-4105). The
combined evaluation of all 101 PET/CT demonstrated an impact on patient
management in 78,5% of cases (48,5% confirmed, 30% suspected). Results of 21,5%
of the PET/CT examinations were misleading. Respective values at baseline and at 
follow-up were: impact on patient management in 82% and 74,5% (70% and 27.5%
confirmed, and 12% and 47% suspected), misleading cases in 18% and 25.5%.
CONCLUSION: In MAA, PET/CT has a high impact on patient management, which is more
pronounced with baseline than with follow-up examinations. However, PET/CT
results may be misleading in a smaller proportion of cases.

Importance: Although tramadol is increasingly used to manage chronic noncancer
pain, few safety studies have compared it with other opioids.
Objective: To assess the associations of tramadol, compared with codeine, with
mortality and other adverse clinical outcomes as used in outpatient settings.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, population-based, propensity
score-matched cohort study using a primary care database with routinely collected
medical records and pharmacy dispensations covering more than 80% of the
population of Catalonia, Spain (≈6 million people). Patients 18 years or older
with 1 or more year of available data and dispensation of tramadol or codeine
(2007-2017) were included and followed up to December 31, 2017.
Exposures: New prescription dispensation of tramadol or codeine (no dispensation 
in the previous year).
Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes studied were all-cause mortality,
cardiovascular events, fractures, constipation, delirium, falls, opioid
abuse/dependence, and sleep disorders within 1 year after the first dispensation.
Absolute rate differences (ARDs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence
intervals were calculated using cause-specific Cox models.
Results: Of the 1 093 064 patients with a tramadol or codeine dispensation during
the study period (326 921 for tramadol, 762 492 for codeine, 3651 for both drugs 
concomitantly), a total of 368 960 patients (184 480 propensity score-matched
pairs) were included after study exclusions and propensity score matching (mean
age, 53.1 [SD, 16.1] years; 57.3% women). Compared with codeine, tramadol
dispensation was significantly associated with a higher risk of all-cause
mortality (incidence, 13.00 vs 5.61 per 1000 person-years; HR, 2.31 [95% CI,
2.08-2.56]; ARD, 7.37 [95% CI, 6.09-8.78] per 1000 person-years), cardiovascular 
events (incidence, 10.03 vs 8.67 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.15 [95% CI,
1.05-1.27]; ARD, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.45-2.36] per 1000 person-years), and fractures
(incidence, 12.26 vs 8.13 per 1000 person-years; HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65];
ARD, 4.10 [95% CI, 3.02-5.29] per 1000 person-years). No significant difference
was observed for the risk of falls, delirium, constipation, opioid
abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this population-based cohort study, a new
prescription dispensation of tramadol, compared with codeine, was significantly
associated with a higher risk of subsequent all-cause mortality, cardiovascular
events, and fractures, but there was no significant difference in the risk of
constipation, delirium, falls, opioid abuse/dependence, or sleep disorders. The
findings should be interpreted cautiously, given the potential for residual
confounding.

BACKGROUND: Prior literature suggests that psychosocial factors adversely impact 
health and health care utilization outcomes. However, psychosocial factors are
typically not captured by the structured data in electronic medical records
(EMRs) but are rather recorded as free text in different types of clinical notes.
OBJECTIVE: We here propose a text-mining approach to analyze EMRs to identify
older adults with key psychosocial factors that predict adverse health care
utilization outcomes, measured by 30-day readmission. The psychological factors
were appended to the LACE (Length of stay, Acuity of the admission, Comorbidity
of the patient, and Emergency department use) Index for Readmission to improve
the prediction of readmission risk.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using EMR notes of 43,216
hospitalization encounters in a hospital from January 1, 2017 to February 28,
2019. The mean age of the cohort was 67.51 years (SD 15.87), the mean length of
stay was 5.57 days (SD 10.41), and the mean intensive care unit stay was 5% (SD
22%). We employed text-mining techniques to extract psychosocial topics that are 
representative of these patients and tested the utility of these topics in
predicting 30-day hospital readmission beyond the predictive value of the LACE
Index for Readmission.
RESULTS: The added text-mined factors improved the area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of the readmission prediction by 8.46% for
geriatric patients, 6.99% for the general hospital population, and 6.64% for
frequent admitters. Medical social workers and case managers captured more of the
psychosocial text topics than physicians.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of extracting 
psychosocial factors from EMR clinical notes and the value of these notes in
improving readmission risk prediction. Psychosocial profiles of patients can be
curated and quantified from text mining clinical notes and these profiles can be 
successfully applied to artificial intelligence models to improve readmission
risk prediction.

We need to effectively combine the knowledge from surging literature with complex
datasets to propose mechanistic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, improving data
interpretation and predicting key targets of intervention. Here, we describe a
large-scale community effort to build an open access, interoperable and
computable repository of COVID-19 molecular mechanisms. The COVID-19 Disease Map 
(C19DMap) is a graphical, interactive representation of disease-relevant
molecular mechanisms linking many knowledge sources. Notably, it is a
computational resource for graph-based analyses and disease modelling. To this
end, we established a framework of tools, platforms and guidelines necessary for 
a multifaceted community of biocurators, domain experts, bioinformaticians and
computational biologists. The diagrams of the C19DMap, curated from the
literature, are integrated with relevant interaction and text mining databases.
We demonstrate the application of network analysis and modelling approaches by
concrete examples to highlight new testable hypotheses. This framework helps to
find signatures of SARS-CoV-2 predisposition, treatment response or
prioritisation of drug candidates. Such an approach may help deal with new waves 
of COVID-19 or similar pandemics in the long-term perspective.

This study aimed to measure dose in a scanning carbon beam-irradiation field with
high sampling rate that is sufficient for identifying spots and verifying the
characteristics of the scanning beam that cannot generally be derived from the
dose. To identify the spot, which is the smallest control unit of beam
information during irradiation, effecting measurements with a sampling time of 10
μs or shorter is necessary. The provided dose within a specific time is referred 
to as time-resolved dose (TRD). We designed a circuit for time-resolved dosimetry
using a fast-data acquisition unit (SL1000, Yokogawa Electric Co.), which can
measure 100 000 samples per second. Moreover, we used converters to enable a
connection between an ionization chamber (IC) and the SL1000. TRD was measured
successfully using point irradiation and two-dimensional irradiation patterns in 
a scanned carbon beam. Based on the moving time of the spot obtained from the
position monitor, the dose delivered to the IC from each spot position (spot
dose) was interpreted. The spot dose, displacement of the chamber from the beam's
center axis, and beam size were derived using TRD and position monitor outputs,
which were measured concurrent with TRD. Spot dose up to a radius of 8 mm area
from the IC's center were observed. Using the spot-dose equations and simulation,
we show that the spot dose of each position varies depending on the beam size and
displacement of the IC's center from the beam's center axis. We devise an
interpretation method for the characteristics that may apply to quality
assurance, such as the verification of the trend for the beam axis and isocenter 
to coincide, as well as beam-size verification.

OBJECTIVE: This analysis has identified and characterized new users of
second-generation antipsychotics (SGA) in Italy and has assessed the occurrence
of cardio-metabolic (CM) events over 3 years after the SGA starting therapy and
the annual healthcare costs, in the perspective of the Italian National Health
System (INHS).
METHODS: Starting from the Fondazione ReS (Ricerca e Salute)'s database, adults
treated with SGA in 2015 (index supply) were selected. By analyzing 2 previous
years, treatment incidence and presence/absence of CM diseases or predisposing
conditions (PC) to these events were defined and 3 cohorts were identified: A)
with CM or predisposing conditions, B) only with PC, C) without neither CM nor
predisposing conditions. Cohorts B and C were paired with patients with the same 
clinical profiles but without any SGA supply. Into cohorts and related paired
groups, CM diseases/predisposing conditions occurred (cases) during the 3-year
follow-up after the index supply were searched. Cases were compared with related 
control groups in terms of probability of CM disease/predisposing conditions
occurrence (survival analysis to the event - Kaplan-Meier curves).
RESULTS: Among more than 4 million adults, 12,218 were incident to SGA (2.8
x1,000): 2,732 composed cohort A (22.5%) with median age 80 (69;87), 1,492 cohort
B (12.3%) with median age 77 (63;85), 7,904 cohort C (65.2%) with median age 60
(37;84). They were mostly females. The treatment incidence increased with age.
The probabilities of CM events were: 15.8% and 13.3% among cases and controls of 
cohort B, and 7.5% and 5.1% among cases and controls of cohort C. Probabilities
of predisposing conditions occurrence were 10% and 7.0% among cases and controls 
of cohort C. All differences were significant (p<0.01). The mean integrated
healthcare cost was similar between case and control. Hospitalizations accounted 
for the most expenditure.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CM events or predisposing conditions occurrence in the
elderly is both a clinical and an economic issue for the INHS. The proper
therapeutic choice and monitoring of patient treated with antipsychotics must be 
encouraged.

Sepsis develops after a dysregulated host inflammatory response to a systemic
infection. Identification of sepsis biomarkers has been challenging because of
the multifactorial causes of disease susceptibility and progression. Public
transcriptomic data are a valuable resource for mechanistic discoveries and
cross-studies concordance of heterogeneous diseases. Nonetheless, the approach
requires structured methodologies and effective visualization tools for
meaningful data interpretation. Currently, no such database exists for sepsis or 
systemic inflammatory diseases in human. Hence we curated SysInflam HuDB
(http://sepsis.gxbsidra.org/dm3/geneBrowser/list), a unique collection of human
blood transcriptomic datasets associated with systemic inflammatory responses to 
sepsis. The transcriptome collection and the associated clinical metadata are
integrated onto a user-friendly and Web-based interface that allows the
simultaneous exploration, visualization, and interpretation of multiple datasets 
stemming from different study designs. To date, the collection encompasses 62
datasets and 5719 individual profiles. Concordance of gene expression changes
with the associated literature was assessed, and additional analyses are
presented to showcase database utility. Combined with custom data visualization
at the group and individual levels, SysInflam HuDB facilitates the identification
of specific human blood gene signatures in response to infection (e.g., patients 
with sepsis versus healthy control subjects) and the delineation of major genetic
drivers associated with inflammation onset and progression under various
conditions.

BACKGROUND: Phase contrast (PC) cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging
with parallel imaging acceleration is established and validated for measuring
velocity and flow. However, additional acceleration to further shorten
acquisition times would be beneficial in patients with complex vasculature who
need multiple PC-CMR measurements, especially pediatric patients with higher
heart rates.
METHODS: PC-CMR images acquired with compressed sensitivity encoding (C-SENSE)
factors of 3 to 6 and standard of care PC-CMR with sensitivity encoding (SENSE)
factor of 2 (S2) acquired as part of clinical CMR examinations performed between 
November 2020 and January 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. The velocity and
flow through the ascending aorta (AAo), descending aorta (DAo), and superior vena
cava (SVC) in a transverse plane at the level of pulmonary artery bifurcation
were compared. Additionally, frequency power distribution and dynamic time warp
distance were calculated for these acquisitions. To further validate the adequate
temporal resolution requirement, patients with S2 PC-CMR in the same acquisition 
plane were added in frequency power distribution analysis.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (25 males; 15.9 ± 1.9 years; body surface area
(BSA) 1.7 ± 0.2 m2; heart rate 81 ± 16 bpm) underwent all five PC-CMR
acquisitions during the study period. An additional 22 patients (16 males;
17.5 ± 7.7 years; BSA 1.6 ± 0.5 m2; heart rate 91 ± 16 bpm) were included for
frequency power spectrum analysis. As expected, scan time decreased with
increasing C-SENSE acceleration factor = 3 (37.5 ± 6.5 s, 26.4 ± 7.6%), 4
(28.1 ± 4.9 s, 44.7 ± 5.6%), 5 (21.6 ± 3.6 s, 57.6 ± 4.4%), and 6 (19.1 ± 3.2 s, 
62.3 ± 4.2%) relative to SENSE = 2 (51.3 ± 10.1 s) PC-CMR acquisition. Mean peak 
velocity, net flow, and cardiac output were comparable (p > 0.87) between the
five PC-CMR acquisitions with mean differences less than < 4%, < 2%, and < 3%
respectively. All individual blood vessels showed a non-significant dependence of
difference in fmax99 (< 4 Hz, p > 0.2), and dynamic time warp distance (p > 0.3) 
on the C-SENSE acceleration factor used. There was a strongly correlated
(r = 0.74) increase in fmax99 (10.5 ± 2.2, range: 7.1-16.4 Hz) with increasing
heart rate. The computed minimum required cardiac phase number was 15 ± 2.0
(range: 11-20) over the heart rate of 86 ± 15 bpm (range: 58-113 bpm).
CONCLUSIONS: Stroke volume, cardiac output, and mean peak velocity measurements
using PC-CMR with C-SENSE of up to 6 agree with measurements by standard of care 
PC-CMR with SENSE = 2 and resulted in up to a 65% reduction in acquisition time. 
Adequate temporal sampling can be ensured by acquiring 20 cardiac phases
throughout the entire cardiac cycle over a wide range of pediatric and young
adult heart rates.

Livestock farming is currently undergoing a digital revolution and becoming
increasingly data-driven. Yet, such data often reside in disconnected silos
making them impossible to leverage their full potential to improve animal
well-being. Here, we introduce a precision livestock farming approach, bringing
together information streams from a variety of life domains of dairy cattle to
study whether including more and diverse data sources improves the quality of
predictions for eight diseases and whether using more complex prediction
algorithms can, to some extent, compensate for less diverse data. Using three
machine learning approaches of varying complexity (from logistic regression to
gradient boosted trees) trained on data from 5,828 animals in 165 herds in
Austria, we show that the prediction of lameness, acute and chronic mastitis,
anestrus, ovarian cysts, metritis, ketosis (hyperketonemia), and periparturient
hypocalcemia (milk fever) from routinely available data gives encouraging
results. For example, we can predict lameness with high sensitivity and
specificity (F1 = 0.74). An analysis of the importance of individual variables to
prediction performance shows that disease in dairy cattle is a product of the
complex interplay between a multitude of life domains, such as housing,
nutrition, or climate, that including more and diverse data sources increases
prediction performance, and that the reuse of existing data can create actionable
information for preventive interventions. Our findings pave the way toward
data-driven point-of-care interventions and demonstrate the added value of
integrating all available data in the dairy industry to improve animal well-being
and reduce disease risk.

Importance: Many insurers waived cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations
during 2020. Nonetheless, patients may have been billed if their plans did not
implement waivers or if waivers did not capture all hospitalization-related care.
Assessment of out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in 2020 may
show the financial burden that patients may experience if insurers allow waivers 
to expire, as many chose to do during 2021.
Objective: To estimate out-of-pocket spending for COVID-19 hospitalizations in
the US in 2020.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the 
IQVIA PharMetrics Plus for Academics Database, a national claims database
representing 7.7 million privately insured patients and 1.0 million Medicare
Advantage patients, regarding COVID-19 hospitalizations for privately insured and
Medicare Advantage patients from March to September 2020.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean total out-of-pocket spending, defined as the sum
of out-of-pocket spending for facility services billed by hospitals (eg,
accommodation charges) and professional and ancillary services billed by
clinicians and ancillary providers (eg, clinician inpatient evaluation and
management, ambulance transport).
Results: Analyses included 4075 hospitalizations; 2091 (51.3%) were for male
patients, and the mean (SD) age of patients was 66.8 (14.8) years. Of these
hospitalizations, 1377 (33.8%) were for privately insured patients. Out-of-pocket
spending for facility services, professional and ancillary services, or both was 
reported for 981 of 1377 hospitalizations for privately insured patients (71.2%) 
and 1324 of 2968 hospitalizations for Medicare Advantage patients (49.1%). Among 
these hospitalizations, mean (SD) total out-of-pocket spending was $788 ($1411)
for privately insured patients and $277 ($363) for Medicare Advantage patients.
In contrast, out-of-pocket spending for facility services was reported for 63
hospitalizations for privately insured patients (4.6%) and 36 hospitalizations
for Medicare Advantage patients (1.3%). Among these hospitalizations, mean (SD)
total out-of-pocket spending was $3840 ($3186) for privately insured patients and
$1536 ($1402) for Medicare Advantage patients. Total out-of-pocket spending
exceeded $4000 for 2.5% of privately insured hospitalizations compared with 0.2% 
of Medicare Advantage hospitalizations.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, few patients
hospitalized for COVID-19 in 2020 were billed for facility services provided by
hospitals, suggesting that most were covered by insurers with cost-sharing
waivers. However, many patients were billed for professional and ancillary
services, suggesting that insurer cost-sharing waivers may not have covered all
hospitalization-related care. High cost sharing for patients who were billed by
facility services suggests that out-of-pocket spending may be substantial for
patients whose insurers have allowed waivers to expire.

OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to identify potential safety signals of
chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), over the period preceding their
repurpose as COVID-19 treatment options, through the analysis of safety data
retrieved from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) pharmacovigilance
database.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis of FAERS data
between the first quarter of 2004 and December 2019 using the OpenVigil2.1-MedDRA
software. Disproportionality was quantified using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) 
and its 95% confidence interval (CIs). The reported mortality of CQ and HCQ was
also investigated.
RESULTS: The dataset contained 6,635,356 reports. Comparison of the RORs revealed
significant differences between CQ and HCQ for the following adverse events:
cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, retinal disorders, corneal disorders,
hearing disorders, headache, hepatic disorders, severe cutaneous reactions,
musculoskeletal disorders, and cytopenia. Only CQ was associated with psychotic
disorders, suicide, self-injury, convulsions, peripheral neuropathy, and
decreased appetite. In multivariable logistic regression, death was more
frequently associated with CQ use, advanced age, male sex, co-reported suicide
and self-injury, cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, and decreased appetite.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm previously published evidence and suggest that
HCQ has a safer clinical profile compared to CQ, and thus could serve as the drug
of choice for future therapeutic purposes.

The advent of the internet has brought an era of unprecedented connectivity
between networked devices, making one distributed computing, called cloud
computing, and popular. This has also resulted in a dire need for remote
authentication schemes for transferring files of a sensitive nature, especially
health-related information between patients, smart health cards, and cloud
servers via smart health card solution providers. In this article, we elaborate
on our proposed approach for such a system and accomplish an informal analysis to

The sharing of research data is essential to ensure reproducibility and maximize 
the impact of public investments in scientific research. Here, we describe
OpenNeuro, a BRAIN Initiative data archive that provides the ability to openly
share data from a broad range of brain imaging data types following the FAIR
principles for data sharing. We highlight the importance of the Brain Imaging
Data Structure standard for enabling effective curation, sharing, and reuse of
data. The archive presently shares more than 600 datasets including data from
more than 20,000 participants, comprising multiple species and measurement
modalities and a broad range of phenotypes. The impact of the shared data is
evident in a growing number of published reuses, currently totalling more than
150 publications. We conclude by describing plans for future development and
integration with other ongoing open science efforts.

OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous microwave ablation is an essential and safe method for
the treatment of liver cancer. As one therapeutic dose, ablation time is crucial 
to the treatment effect determined by the physicians. However, due to the
different experiences of physicians and the significant individual differences of
patients, the final treatment effect is also different, which makes it difficult 
for the ablation time recorded in the electronic health records (EHRs) to follow 
the same pattern. To solve this problem, we propose a data mining method based on
historical treatment data recorded in EHR, which uses a robust relapse risk as
strong supervision to correct the ablation time. The prediction results of this
method are closer to the situation of patients without relapse, which can provide
physicians with reference.
METHODS: In the proposed method, we introduce the optimization method to
iteratively minimize the postoperative relapse risk and utilize gradient
propagation between the risk and ablation time during iteration to correct the
latter. We also apply a self-attention mechanism to find the global dependencies 
between each feature in EHR to improve the final prediction performance of the
model.
RESULTS: Comparative experimental results show that compared with other baseline 
model, the proposed model achieves better performance on R-square, MAE, and MSE
metric. The results of ablation experiments show that the integration of label
correction and self-attention mechanism can improve the model performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We using relapse risk as strong supervision related to the ablation 
time can effectively correct the deviation of the ablation time as weak
supervision. The self-attention mechanism in the proposed model can significantly
improve the prediction performance.

Dronedarone may increase exposure and the risk of major bleeding when prescribed 
with a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). This retrospective cohort study examined
the risk of the first occurrence of major bleeding (hospitalization or emergency 
room visit for gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], or 
bleeding at other sites) among new users of apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban
in patients with AF ≥18 years (January 1, 2007 to September 30, 2017) from the
United States Truven Health MarketScan claims, comparing concomitant users of
dronedarone to DOAC alone users in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). No
increased risk of major bleeding was associated with use of dronedarone and
apixaban (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR]: 0.69 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40, 
1.17], p = 0.16), a modestly increased risk of GI bleeding but not overall
bleeding was associated with use of dronedarone and dabigatran (aHR bleeding:
1.18 [95% CI: 0.89, 1.56], p = 0.26; aHR GI bleeding: 1.40 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.93]; 
p = 0.04) and an increased risk of overall bleeding, driven by GI bleeding, was
associated with use of dronedarone and rivaroxaban (aHR bleeding: 1.31 [95% CI:
1.01, 1.69]; p = 0.04; aHR GI bleeding: 1.39 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.95]; p = 0.06),
compared to each DOAC respectively. There was no increased risk of ICH associated
with combined use of dronedarone and any DOAC. Prospective analyses, preferably
randomized controlled studies, are needed to further explore the risk of major
bleeding with concomitant use of DOACs and CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors such as
dronedarone.

BACKGROUND: Identifying human protein-phenotype relationships has attracted
researchers in bioinformatics and biomedical natural language processing due to
its importance in uncovering rare and complex diseases. Since experimental
validation of protein-phenotype associations is prohibitive, automated tools
capable of accurately extracting these associations from the biomedical text are 
in high demand. However, while the manual annotation of protein-phenotype
co-mentions required for training such models is highly resource-consuming,
extracting millions of unlabeled co-mentions is straightforward.
RESULTS: In this study, we propose a novel deep semi-supervised ensemble
framework that combines deep neural networks, semi-supervised, and ensemble
learning for classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions with the help of
unlabeled data. This framework allows the ability to incorporate an extensive
collection of unlabeled sentence-level co-mentions of human proteins and
phenotypes with a small labeled dataset to enhance overall performance. We
develop PPPredSS, a prototype of our proposed semi-supervised framework that
combines sophisticated language models, convolutional networks, and recurrent
networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides a new state-of-the-art performance in classifying human
protein-phenotype co-mentions by outperforming other supervised and
semi-supervised counterparts. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of PPPredSS
in powering a curation assistant system through case studies involving a group of
biologists.
CONCLUSIONS: This article presents a novel approach for human protein-phenotype
co-mention classification based on deep, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning. 
The insights and findings from this work have implications for biomedical
researchers, biocurators, and the text mining community working on biomedical
relationship extraction.

The information system stress, informatics competence and well-being of newly
graduated and experienced nurses: a cross-sectional study.

BACKGROUND: The use of information systems takes up a significant amount of
nurses' daily working time. Increased use of the systems requires nurses to have 
adequate competence in nursing informatics and is known to be a potential source 
of stress. However, little is known about the role of nursing informatics
competence and stress related to information systems (SRIS) in the well-being of 
nurses. Moreover, the potential impact of nurses' career stage on this matter is 
unknown. This study examined whether SRIS and nursing informatics competence are 
associated with stress and psychological distress in newly graduated nurses
(NGNs) and experienced nurses.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Finland between October and
December 2018. The participants were NGNs (n = 712) with less than two years of
work experience and experienced nurses (n = 1226) with more than two years of
work experience. The associations of nursing informatics and SRIS with nurses'
stress and psychological distress were analyzed with linear regression analysis. 
Analyses were conducted separately for NGNs and experienced nurses. Models were
adjusted for age, gender, and work environment.
RESULTS: SRIS was associated with stress / psychological distress for both NGNs
(β = 0.26 p < 0.001 / β = 0.22 p < 0.001) and experienced nurses (β = 0.21
p < 0.001/ β = 0.12 p < 0.001). Higher nursing informatics competence was
associated with lower stress (β = 0.20 p < 0.001) and psychological distress
(β = 0.16 p < 0.001) in NGNs, but not among experienced nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: SRIS appears to be an equal source of stress and distress for nurses
who are starting their careers and for more experienced nurses, who are also
likely to be more experienced users of information systems. However, informatics 
competence played a more important role among NGNs and a lack of adequate
competence seems to add to the strain that is already known to be high in the
early stages of a career. It would be important for educational institutions to
invest in nursing informatics so that new nurses entering the workforce have
sufficient skills to work in increasingly digital health care.

Applying text mining to identify relevant literature in food science: Cold
denaturation as a case study.

In a research environment characterized by the five V's of big data, volume,
velocity, variety, value, and veracity, the need to develop tools that quickly
screen a large number of publications into relevant work is an increasing area of
concern, and the data-rich food industry is no exception. Here, a combination of 
latent Dirichlet allocation and food keyword searches were employed to analyze
and filter a dataset of 6102 publications about cold denaturation. After using
the Python toolkit generated in this work, the approach yielded 22 topics that
provide background and insight on the direction of research in this field, as
well as identified the publications in this dataset which are most pertinent to
the food industry with precision and recall of 0.419 and 0.949, respectively.
Precision is related to the relevance of a paper in the filtered dataset and the 
recall represents papers which were not identified in the screening method.
Lastly, gaps in the literature based on keyword trends are identified to improve 
the knowledge base of cold denaturation as it relates to the food industry. This 
approach is generalizable to any similarly organized dataset, and the code is
available upon request. Practical Application: A common problem in research is
that when you are an expert in one field, learning about another field is
difficult, because you may lack the vocabulary and background needed to read
cutting edge literature from a new discipline. The Python toolkit developed in
this research can be applied by any researcher that is new to a field to identify
what the key literature is, what topics they should familiarize themselves with, 
and what the current trends are in the field. Using this structure, researchers
can greatly speed up how they identify new areas to research and find new
projects.

Biomedical and life science literature is an essential way to publish
experimental results. With the rapid growth of the number of new publications,
the amount of scientific knowledge represented in free text is increasing
remarkably. There has been much interest in developing techniques that can
extract this knowledge and make it accessible to aid scientists in discovering
new relationships between biological entities and answering biological questions.
Making use of the word2vec approach, we generated word vector representations
based on a corpus consisting of over 16 million PubMed abstracts. We developed a 
text mining pipeline to produce word2vec embeddings with different properties and
performed validation experiments to assess their utility for biomedical analysis.
An important pre-processing step consisted in the substitution of synonymous
terms by their preferred terms in biomedical databases. Furthermore, we extracted
gene-gene networks from two embedding versions and used them as prior knowledge
to train Graph-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large breast cancer gene
expression data and on other cancer datasets. Performances of resulting models
were compared to Graph-CNNs trained with protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks or with networks derived using other word embedding algorithms. We also 
assessed the effect of corpus size on the variability of word representations.
Finally, we created a web service with a graphical and a RESTful interface to
extract and explore relations between biomedical terms using annotated
embeddings. Comparisons to biological databases showed that relations between
entities such as known PPIs, signaling pathways and cellular functions, or
narrower disease ontology groups correlated with higher cosine similarity.
Graph-CNNs trained with word2vec-embedding-derived networks performed
sufficiently good for the metastatic event prediction tasks compared to other
networks. Such performance was good enough to validate the utility of our
generated word embeddings in constructing biological networks. Word
representations as produced by text mining algorithms like word2vec, therefore
are able to capture biologically meaningful relations between entities. Our
generated embeddings are publicly available at
https://github.com/genexplain/Word2vec-based-Networks/blob/main/README.md.

The unique electron spin, transfer, polarization and magnetoelectric coupling
characteristics of ABO3 multiferroic perovskite materials make them promising
candidates for application in multifunctional nanoelectronic devices. Reversible 
ferroelectric polarization, controllable defect concentration and domain wall
movement originated from the ABO3 multiferroic perovskite materials promotes its 
memristive effect, which further highlights data storage, information processing 
and neuromorphic computing in diverse artificial intelligence applications. In
particular, ion doping, electrode selection, and interface modulation have been
demonstrated in ABO3-based memristive devices for ultrahigh data storage,
ultrafast information processing, and efficient neuromorphic computing. These
approaches presented today including controlling the dopant in the active layer, 
altering the oxygen vacancy distribution, modulating the diffusion depth of ions,
and constructing the interface-dependent band structure were believed to be
efficient methods for obtaining unique resistive switching (RS) behavior for
various applications. In this review, internal physical dynamics, preparation
technologies, and modulation methods are systemically examined as well as the
progress, challenges, and possible solutions are proposed for next generation
emerging ABO3-based memristive application in artificial intelligence.

and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND: Health information exchange (HIE) systems are computer tools that
healthcare providers use to share patients' medical information electronically.
Our study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators perceived by general
practitioners (GPs) when using an HIE system in the Canton of Ticino, a region in
southern Switzerland.
METHODS: We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Ten
GPs participated in the study. We analysed transcripts using thematic content
analysis and following an abductive approach (a mix of deductive and inductive
approaches).
RESULTS: Our findings indicate the following main facilitators of the HIE system:
(a) the perception of having to do with a secure system; (b) the possibility of
delegating its management to secretaries and healthcare assistants; (c) technical
support and training; (d) high quality of the information exchanged; (e) positive
impact on clinical practice; and (f) regional context. However, major challenges 
still persist, and GPs reported the following main barriers to using an HIE
system: (a) a frequent lack of all the patient documentation they needed; (b) no 
effective workflow improvements; and (c) lack of some technical features.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study provide a qualitative perspective of
opinions and experiences of GPs that can inform improvements of the current HIE
system and future federal and cantonal HIE initiatives in Switzerland and
elsewhere.

In recent years, almost every country in the world has struggled against the
spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019. If governments and public health systems do
not take action against the spread of the disease, it will have a severe impact
on human life. A noteworthy technique to stop this pandemic is diagnosing
COVID-19 infected patients and isolating them instantly. The present study
proposes a method for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT images. The method is a
hybrid method based on convolutional neural network which is optimized by a newly
introduced metaheuristic, called marine predator optimization algorithm. This
optimization method is performed to improve the system accuracy. The method is
then implemented on the chest CT scans with the COVID-19-related findings
(MosMedData) dataset, and the results are compared with three other methods from 
the literature to indicate the method's performance. The final results indicate
that the proposed method with 98.11% accuracy, 98.13% precision, 98.66%
sensitivity, and 97.26% F1 score has the highest performance in all indicators
than the compared methods which shows its higher accuracy and reliability.

Introduction: The COVID-19 crisis provides an opportunity to reflect on what
worked during the pandemic, what could have been done differently, and what
innovations should become part of an enhanced health information system in the
future. Methods: An online qualitative survey was designed and administered
online in November 2020 to all the 37 Member States that are part of the WHO
European Health Information Initiative and the WHO Central Asian Republics
Information Network. Results: Nineteen countries responded to the survey
(Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland,
Israel, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Russian Federation,
Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan). The COVID-19 pandemic required
health information systems (HIS) to rapidly adapt to identify, collect, store,
manage, and transmit accurate and timely COVID-19 related data. HIS stakeholders 
have been put to the test, and valuable experience has been gained. Despite
critical gaps such as under-resourced public health services, obsolete health
information technologies, and lack of interoperability, most countries believed
that their information systems had worked reasonably well in addressing the needs
arising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Strong enabling environments
and advanced and digitized health information systems are vital to controlling
epidemics. Sustainable finance and government support are required for the
continued implementation and enhancement of HIS. It is important to promote
digital solutions beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is the time to discuss
potential solutions to obtain timely, accurate, and reliable health information
and steer policy-making while protecting privacy rights and meeting the highest
ethical standards.

National University, Seoul, Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Despite its advantages, it is not yet common practice in Korea for
researchers to investigate disease associations using spatio-temporal analyses.
In this study, we aimed to review health-related epidemiological research using
spatio-temporal analyses and to observe methodological trends.
METHODS: Health-related studies that applied spatial or spatio-temporal methods
were identified using 2 international databases (PubMed and Embase) and 4 Korean 
academic databases (KoreaMed, NDSL, DBpia, and RISS). Two reviewers extracted
data to review the included studies. A search for relevant keywords yielded 5919 
studies.
RESULTS: Of the studies that were initially found, 150 were ultimately included
based on the eligibility criteria. In terms of the research topic, 5 categories
with 11 subcategories were identified: chronic diseases (n=31, 20.7%), infectious
diseases (n=27, 18.0%), health-related topics (including service utilization,
equity, and behavior) (n=47, 31.3%), mental health (n=15, 10.0%), and cancer
(n=7, 4.7%). Compared to the period between 2000 and 2010, more studies published
between 2011 and 2020 were found to use 2 or more spatial analysis techniques
(35.6% of included studies), and the number of studies on mapping increased
6-fold.
CONCLUSIONS: Further spatio-temporal analysis-related studies with point data are
needed to provide insights and evidence to support policy decision-making for the
prevention and control of infectious and chronic diseases using advances in
spatial techniques.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is a respiratory illness associated
with high mortality, has been classified as a pandemic. The major obstacles for
the clinicians to contain the disease are limited information availability,
difficulty in disease diagnosis, predicting disease prognosis, and lack of
disease monitoring tools. Additionally, the lack of valid therapies has further
contributed to the difficulties in containing the pandemic. Recent studies have
reported that the dysregulation of the immune system leads to an ineffective
antiviral response and promotes pathological immune response, which manifests as 
ARDS, myocarditis, and hepatitis. In this study, a novel platform has been
described for disseminating information to physicians for the diagnosis and
monitoring of patients with COVID-19. An adjuvant approach using compounds that
can potentiate antiviral immune response and mitigate COVID-19-induced
immune-mediated target organ damage has been presented. A prolonged beneficial
effect is achieved by implementing algorithm-based individualized variability
measures in the treatment regimen.

Information theoretic approaches are ubiquitous and effective in a wide variety
of bioinformatics applications. In comparative genomics, alignment-free methods, 
based on short DNA words, or k-mers, are particularly powerful. We evaluated the 
utility of varying k-mer lengths for genome comparisons by analyzing their
sequence space coverage of 5805 genomes in the KEGG GENOME database. In
subsequent analyses on four k-mer lengths spanning the relevant range (11, 21,
31, 41), hierarchical clustering of 1634 genus-level representative genomes using
pairwise 21- and 31-mer Jaccard similarities best recapitulated a
phylogenetic/taxonomic tree of life with clear boundaries for superkingdom
domains and high subtree similarity for named taxons at lower levels (family
through phylum). By analyzing ~14.2M prokaryotic genome comparisons by their
lowest-common-ancestor taxon levels, we detected many potential misclassification
errors in a curated database, further demonstrating the need for wide-scale
adoption of quantitative taxonomic classifications based on whole-genome
similarity.

sensing data using Backpropagation Neural Network.

(Beijing), Beijing, China.

The purposes are to solve the isomorphism encountered while processing
hyperspectral remote sensing data and improve the accuracy of hyperspectral
remote sensing data in extracting and classifying lithological information.
Taking rocks as the research object, Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) is
introduced. After the hyperspectral image data are normalized, the lithological
spectrum and spatial information are the feature extraction targets to construct 
a deep learning-based lithological information extraction model. The performance 
of the model is analyzed using specific instance data. Results demonstrate that
the overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficient of the lithological information
extraction and classification model based on deep learning were 90.58% and
0.8676, respectively. This model can precisely distinguish the properties of rock
masses and provide better performance compared with the state of other analysis
models. After introducing deep learning, the recognition accuracy and the Kappa
coefficient of the proposed BPNN model increased by 8.5% and 0.12, respectively, 
compared with the traditional BPNN. The proposed extraction and classification
model can provide some research values and practical significances for the
hyperspectral rock and mineral classification.

This paper explores the evolution of research collaboration networks in the
'stakeholder theory and management' (STM) discipline and identifies the
longitudinal effect of co-authorship networks on research performance, i.e.,
research productivity and citation counts. Research articles totaling 6,127
records from 1989 to 2020 were harvested from the Web of Science Database and
transformed into bibliometric data using Bibexcel, followed by applying social
network analysis to compare and analyze scientific collaboration networks at the 
author, institution and country levels. This work maps the structure of these
networks across three consecutive sub-periods (t1: 1989-1999; t2: 2000-2010; t3: 
2011-2020) and explores the association between authors' social network
properties and their research performance. The results show that authors
collaboration network was fragmented all through the periods, however, with an
increase in the number and size of cliques. Similar results were observed in the 
institutional collaboration network but with less fragmentation between
institutions reflected by the increase in network density as time passed. The
international collaboration had evolved from an uncondensed, fragmented and
highly centralized network, to a highly dense and less fragmented network in t3. 
Moreover, a positive association was reported between authors' research
performance and centrality and structural hole measures in t3 as opposed to
ego-density, constraint and tie strength in t1. The findings can be used by
policy makers to improve collaboration and develop research programs that can
enhance several scientific fields. Central authors identified in the networks are
better positioned to receive government funding, maximize research outputs and
improve research community reputation. Viewed from a network's perspective,
scientists can understand how collaborative relationships influence research
performance and consider where to invest their decision and choices.

The spread of a communicable disease is a complex spatio-temporal process shaped 
by the specific transmission mechanism, and diverse factors including the
behavior, socio-economic and demographic properties of the host population. While
the key factors shaping transmission of influenza and COVID-19 are beginning to
be broadly understood, making precise forecasts on case count and mortality is
still difficult. In this study we introduce the concept of a universal geospatial
risk phenotype of individual US counties facilitating flu-like transmission
mechanisms. We call this the Universal Influenza-like Transmission (UnIT) score, 
which is computed as an information-theoretic divergence of the local incidence
time series from an high-risk process of epidemic initiation, inferred from
almost a decade of flu season incidence data gleaned from the diagnostic history 
of nearly a third of the US population. Despite being computed from the past
seasonal flu incidence records, the UnIT score emerges as the dominant factor
explaining incidence trends for the COVID-19 pandemic over putative demographic
and socio-economic factors. The predictive ability of the UnIT score is further
demonstrated via county-specific weekly case count forecasts which consistently
outperform the state of the art models throughout the time-line of the COVID-19
pandemic. This study demonstrates that knowledge of past epidemics may be used to
chart the course of future ones, if transmission mechanisms are broadly similar, 
despite distinct disease processes and causative pathogens.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the dose difference between measurement and double Gaussian 
beam model prediction according to the field size and correct the measurements in
patient-specific quality assurance (QA).
METHODS: The field size dependence of the dose was evaluated with volumes of 20 ×
20 × 80 mm3 , 40 × 40 × 80 mm3 , 60 × 60 × 80 mm3 , and 80 × 80 × 80 mm3 of 1 Gy 
uniform dose at three depths. Additional two 80 × 80 × 80 mm3 volumes of
nonuniform fields were created: one high-dose field was given 1 Gy at the central
40 × 40 mm2 and 0.5 Gy in its surrounding, and the other low-dose field was given
0.5 Gy in the middle and 1 Gy at the periphery. The dose in the center of the
spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) was measured in a water phantom and compared with
the treatment planning system (TPS) predication. A field factor based on the
two-dimensional (2D) dose distribution was proposed to estimate the field size.
The field factor was first evaluated against the dose difference in the square
fields, and then used to analyze and correct the patient-specific QA results.
RESULTS: TPS overestimated dose for fields smaller than 80 × 80 mm2 . A
practically positive correlation was observed between the measured dose and the
field factor. In the patient-specific QA, measured doses were lower than the TPS 
predication as they were calculated a relatively small field factor. The
corrected dose differences were no longer field factor dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the proposed field factor, we have shown that all the
measurements with a large dose deviation were due to the small-sized field. It is
clinically relevant to take into consideration the field size in the QA analysis 
as long as the double Gaussian beam model being used for the dose calculation.
Correction to the measurement can be made based on the field factor.

During the last two decades, Port Sudan City has witnessed major environmental
stresses resulting from urban expansion and port extensions. This research aims
at analysing land water changes (LWCs), land use land cover (LULC) changes and
urban expansion of Port Sudan using remote sensing and GIS. For that purpose, an 
integrated remote sensing and GIS approach was designed to analyse two Enhanced
Thematic Mapper (ETM) and an Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat images
covering the period from 1999 to 2018. LWCs were detected using mathematical
remote sensing and GIS-based procedures, while LULC changes were analysed through
a post-classification comparison (PCC) approach using a support vector machine
(SVM) classifier for classification. Major detected LWCs include landfill
activities in the port area and north lagoon of Kilo Tamanya, and dredging
activities in Khor Mog. Areas gained by landfill may have improved the port and
transport functions but buried coral reefs and caused environmental problems as
well. Furthermore, the urban areas were twice doubled, which was mostly rapid and
uncontrolled, adding more pressure to the already stressed services and
administrative sectors. Threats to the agricultural and mangrove areas were also 
analysed. The agricultural and mangrove areas were decreased by 40% each, which
has been shown to have negative impacts on society, food security and
biodiversity. Sadly, the lost agricultural lands were changed into bare soil,
slums and other industrial uses. In contrast, mesquite forests were naturally
increased by 74%. Mesquites have a major role in combating desertification and
providing energy for domestic use. The driving forces and constraints of the
urban expansion were highlighted. The change information provided by the applied 
approach will support decision-makers in adopting integrated and compatible land 
and coast management planning in the studied coastal city.

Identification of the Molecular Subgroups in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis by
Gene Expression Profiles.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Respiratory Medicine, Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese
Medicine, Affiliated to Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.

Background: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most common
idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, which can occur all over the world. The median
survival time of patients is about 3-5 years, and the mortality is relatively
high.
Objective: To reveal the potential molecular characteristics of IPF and deepen
the understanding of the molecular mechanism of IPF. In order to provide some
guidance for the clinical treatment, new drug development, and prognosis judgment
of IPF. Although the preliminary conclusion of this study has certain guiding
significance for the treatment of IPF and so on, it needs more accurate
analytical approaches and large sample clinical trials to verify.
Methods: 220 patients with IPF were divided into different subgroups according to
the gene expression profiles, which were obtained from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database. In addition, these subgroups present different expression
forms and clinical features. Therefore, weighted gene coexpression analysis
(WGCNA) was used to seek the differences between subtypes. And six
subgroup-specific WGCNA modules were identified.
Results: Combined with the characteristics of WGCNA and KEGG enrichment modules, 
the autophagic pathway was only upregulated in subgroup I and enriched
significantly. The differentiation pathways of Th1 and Th2 cells were only
upregulated and enriched in subgroup II. At the same time, combined with clinical
information, IPF patients in subgroup II were older and more serious, which may
be closely related to the differentiation of Th1 and Th2 cells. In contrast, the 
neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and Ca+ signaling pathway were
significantly upregulated and enriched in subgroup III. Although there was no
significant difference in prognosis between subgroup I and subgroup III, their
intrinsic biological characteristics were very different. These results suggest
that the subtypes may represent risk factors of age and intrinsic biological
characteristics and may also partly reflect the severity of the disease.
Conclusion: In conclusion, current studies have improved our understanding of
IPF-related molecular mechanisms. At the same time, because the results show that
patients from different subgroups may have their own unique gene expression
patterns, it reminds us that patients in each subgroup should receive more
personalized treatment.

SCMAG: A Semisupervised Single-Cell Clustering Method Based on Matrix Aggregation
Graph Convolutional Neural Network.

Clustering analysis is one of the most important technologies for single-cell
data mining. It is widely used in the division of different gene sequences, the
identification of functional genes, and the detection of new cell types. Although
the traditional unsupervised clustering method does not require label data, the
distribution of the original data, the setting of hyperparameters, and other
factors all affect the effectiveness of the clustering algorithm. While in some
cases the type of some cells is known, it is hoped to achieve high accuracy if
the prior information about those cells is utilized sufficiently. In this study, 
we propose SCMAG (a semisupervised single-cell clustering method based on a
matrix aggregation graph convolutional neural network) that takes into full
consideration the prior information for single-cell data. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed semisupervised clustering method, we test on
different single-cell datasets and compare with the current semisupervised
clustering algorithm in recognizing cell types on various real scRNA-seq data;
the results show that it is a more accurate and significant model.

The task of segmenting cytoplasm in cytology images is one of the most
challenging tasks in cervix cytological analysis due to the presence of fuzzy and
highly overlapping cells. Deep learning-based diagnostic technology has proven to
be effective in segmenting complex medical images. We present a two-stage
framework based on Mask RCNN to automatically segment overlapping cells. In stage
one, candidate cytoplasm bounding boxes are proposed. In stage two,
pixel-to-pixel alignment is used to refine the boundary and category
classification is also presented. The performance of the proposed method is
evaluated on publicly available datasets from ISBI 2014 and 2015. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other
state-of-the-art approaches with DSC 0.92 and FPRp 0.0008 at the DSC threshold of
0.8. Those results indicate that our Mask RCNN-based segmentation method could be
effective in cytological analysis.

BACKGROUND: Long-term care (LTC) services are a professional service-driven (PSD)
system; to deliver appropriate care services to residents, health care providers 
first need to collect appropriate patient data and make a professional
assessment. A well-designed LTC information system should therefore consider the 
information requirements of multidisciplinary health care providers to adequately
support their care services.
OBJECTIVES: This study proposed a modified service blueprint-the PSD service
blueprint-for visualizing interdisciplinary service providers' input and output
information requirements, which correspond to their service activities.
METHODS: The PSD service blueprint comprises five layers and seven elements. We
also present a case study to illustrate the blueprint's application to daily LTC 
services.
RESULTS: Our proposed approach could clearly illustrate the daily care
activities, service providers (main actors), actors' input and output
information, and suggestions for LTC information system-related applications.
CONCLUSION: The proposed PSD service blueprint can not only gather
interdisciplinary LTC service providers' information system requirements but also
act as a mapping tool for visualizing the care service process.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the completeness and concordance of infant deaths from
congenital syphilis in the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, between 2010
and 2017.
METHODS: This was a descriptive study based on linkage between the Mortality
Information System (SIM) and the Live Birth Information System (SINASC). Deaths
with mention of congenital syphilis in multiple causes of death were analyzed.
The completeness of 11 SIM variables was analyzed and SINASC was adopted as the
reference. The Kappa statistic was used to analyze concordance.
RESULTS: There were 134 recorded congenital syphilis deaths, 132 of which were
linked. 67 had congenital syphilis as the underlying cause, while 65 involved
multiple causes of death, indicating underestimated congenital syphilis
mortality. After linkage, the number of variables with excellent completeness
increased from two to ten.
CONCLUSION: Linking SIM with SINASC data improved completeness. The magnitude of 
congenital syphilis mortality was found to be underestimated, and the use of
multiple causes improved its measurement.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trend of notifications of gestational and congenital
syphilis in Minas Gerais, Brazil, from 2009 to 2019.
METHODS: This was an ecological time series study which took the state of Minas
Gerais as its unit of analysis, based on data reported on the Notifiable Health
Conditions Information System (SINAN). The Prais-Winsten autoregressive model was
used to verify trends.
RESULTS: 20,348 cases of gestational syphilis and 11,173 cases of congenital
syphilis were reported. Average percentage annual increase was 36.7% (95%CI
32.5;41.0), for gestational syphilis incidence rates, and 32.8% (95%CI 28.0;37.8)
for congenital syphilis incidence rates (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The temporal trend analysis showed that gestational and congenital
syphilis incidence rates had significant increasing trends, which may be related 
to inadequate treatment or failure to treat syphilis during pregnancy.

PURPOSE: This study proposed a synchronous measurement method for
patient-specific dosimetry using two three-dimensional dose verification systems 
with delivery errors.
METHODS: Twenty hypofractionated radiotherapy treatment plans for patients with
lung cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Monitor unit (MU) changes, leaf
in-position errors, and angles of deviation of the collimator were intentionally 
introduced to investigate the detection sensitivity of the EDose + EPID (EE) and 
Dolphin + Compass (DC) systems.
RESULTS: Both systems accurately detected the MU modifications and had a similar 
ability to detect leaf in-position errors. The detection of multi-leaf collimator
(MLC) errors was difficult for the whole body using different gamma criteria.
When the introduced MLC error was 1.0 mm, the numbers of errors detected in the
clinical target volume (CTV) by the EE system were 20, 20, and 20 and the numbers
of errors detected by the DC system were 18, 19, and 20, at 3%/2 mm, 2%/2 mm, and
1%/1 mm, respectively. The average dose deviation of all DVH parameters exceeded 
3%. The gamma and DVH evaluation results remained unchanged for the DC system
when different collimator angle errors were introduced. The number of errors
detected by the EE system was <11 for each anatomical structure for all gamma
criteria. The mean dose deviation of the CTV was not distinguished.
CONCLUSIONS: This synchronous measurement approach can effectively eliminate the 
influence of random errors during treatment. The EE and DC systems reconstruct
the three-dimensional dose distribution accurately and are convenient and
reliable for dose verification.

OBJECTIVE: Surge capacity refers to preparedness of health systems to face sudden
patient inflows, such as mass-casualty incidents (MCI). To strengthen surge
capacity, it is essential to understand MCI epidemiology, which is poorly studied
in low- and middle-income countries lacking trauma databases. We propose a novel 
approach, the "systematic media review", to analyze mass-trauma epidemiology;
here piloted in Rwanda.
METHODS: A systematic media review of non-academic publications of MCIs in Rwanda
between January 1st, 2010, and September 1st, 2020 was conducted using NexisUni, 
an academic database for news, business, and legal sources previously used in
sociolegal research. All articles identified by the search strategy were screened
using eligibility criteria. Data were extracted in a RedCap form and analyzed
using descriptive statistics.
FINDINGS: Of 3187 articles identified, 247 met inclusion criteria. In total, 117 
MCIs were described, of which 73 (62.4%) were road-traffic accidents, 23 (19.7%) 
natural hazards, 20 (17.1%) acts of violence/terrorism, and 1 (0.09%) boat
collision. Of Rwanda's 30 Districts, 29 were affected by mass-trauma, with the
rural Western province most frequently affected. Road-traffic accidents was the
leading MCI until 2017 when natural hazards became most common. The median number
of injured persons per event was 11 (IQR 5-18), and median on-site deaths was 2
(IQR 1-6); with natural hazards having the highest median deaths (6 [IQR 2-18]).
CONCLUSION: In Rwanda, MCIs have decreased, although landslides/floods are
increasing, preventing a decrease in trauma-related mortality. By training
journalists in "mass-casualty reporting", the potential of the "systematic media 
review" could be further enhanced, as a way to collect MCI data in settings
without databases.

BACKGROUND: Real-world big data studies using health insurance claims databases
require extraction algorithms to accurately identify target population and
outcome. However, no algorithm for Crohn's disease (CD) has yet been validated.
In this study we aim to develop an algorithm for identifying CD using the claims 
data of the insurance system.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective study to develop a CD extraction algorithm
from insurance claims data was conducted. Patients visiting the Kitasato
University Kitasato Institute Hospital between January 2015-February 2019 were
enrolled, and data were extracted according to inclusion criteria combining the
Tenth Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems (ICD-10) diagnosis codes with or without prescription or 
surgical codes. Hundred cases that met each inclusion criterion were randomly
sampled and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated according to the
diagnosis in the medical chart. Of all cases, 20% were reviewed in duplicate, and
the inter-observer agreement (Kappa) was also calculated.
RESULTS: From the 82,898 enrolled, 255 cases were extracted by diagnosis code
alone, 197 by the combination of diagnosis and prescription codes, and 197 by the
combination of diagnosis codes and prescription or surgical codes. The PPV for
confirmed CD cases was 83% by diagnosis codes alone, but improved to 97% by
combining with prescription codes. The inter-observer agreement was 0.9903.
CONCLUSIONS: Single ICD-code alone was insufficient to define CD; however, the
algorithm that combined diagnosis codes with prescription codes indicated a
sufficiently high PPV and will enable outcome-based research on CD using the
Japanese claims database.

BACKGROUND: Of 58 medication adherence group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM)
published studies, 74% used binary and 26% used continuous GBTM. Few studies
provided a rationale for this choice. No medication adherence studies have
compared continuous and binary GBTM.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess whether continuous versus
binary GBTM: (1) impacts adherence trajectory shapes; and (2) results in the
differential classification of patients into adherence groups.
METHODS: Patients were prevalent statin users with myocardial infarction
hospitalization, 66+ years old, and continuously enrolled in fee-for-service
Medicare. Statin medication adherence was measured 6 months prehospitalization
using administrative claims. Final GBTM specifications beyond default settings
were selected using a previously defined standardized procedure and applied
separately to continuous and binary (proportion of days covered ≥0.80) medication
adherence measures. Assignment to adherence groups was compared between
continuous and binary models using percent agreement of patient classification
and the κ coefficient.
RESULTS: Among 113,296 prevalent statin users, 4 adherence groups were identified
in both models. Three groups were consistent: persistently adherent,
progressively nonadherent, and persistently nonadherent. The fourth continuous
group was moderately adherent (progressively adherent in the binary model). When 
comparing patient assignment into adherence groups between continuous and binary 
trajectory models, only 78.4% of patients were categorized into comparable groups
(κ=0.641; 95% confidence interval: 0.638-0.645). The agreement was highest in the
persistently adherent group (∼94%).
CONCLUSIONS: Continuous and binary trajectory models are conceptually different
measures of medication adherence. The choice between these approaches should be
guided by study objectives and the role of medication adherence within the
study-exposure, outcome, or confounder.

Command-line software plays a critical role in biology research. However,
processes for installing and executing software differ widely. The Common
Workflow Language (CWL) is a community standard that addresses this problem.
Using CWL, tool developers can formally describe a tool's inputs, outputs, and
other execution details. CWL documents can include instructions for executing
tools inside software containers. Accordingly, CWL tools are portable-they can be
executed on diverse computers-including personal workstations, high-performance
clusters, or the cloud. CWL also supports workflows, which describe dependencies 
among tools and using outputs from one tool as inputs to others. To date, CWL has
been used primarily for batch processing of large datasets, especially in
genomics. But it can also be used for analytical steps of a study. This article
explains key concepts about CWL and software containers and provides examples for
using CWL in biology research. CWL documents are text-based, so they can be
created manually, without computer programming. However, ensuring that these
documents conform to the CWL specification may prevent some users from adopting
it. To address this gap, we created ToolJig, a Web application that enables
researchers to create CWL documents interactively. ToolJig validates information 
provided by the user to ensure it is complete and valid. After creating a CWL
tool or workflow, the user can create 'input-object' files, which store values
for a particular invocation of a tool or workflow. In addition, ToolJig provides 
examples of how to execute the tool or workflow via a workflow engine. ToolJig
and our examples are available at https://github.com/srp33/ToolJig.

During the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), immune response
and inflammation reactions are dynamic events that develop rapidly and are
associated with the severity of disease. Here, we aimed to develop a predictive
model based on the immune and inflammatory response to discriminate patients with
severe COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and
immune inflammatory reaction indicators were collected and analyzed. Logistic
regression analysis was performed to identify the independent predictors, which
were further used to construct a predictive model. The predictive performance of 
the model was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve, and optimal
diagnostic threshold was calculated; these were further validated by 5-fold
cross-validation and external validation. We screened three key indicators,
including neutrophils, eosinophils, and IgA, for predicting severe COVID-19 and
obtained a combined neutrophil, eosinophil, and IgA ratio (NEAR) model (NEU
[109/liter] - 150×EOS [109/liter] + 3×IgA [g/liter]). NEAR achieved an area under
the curve (AUC) of 0.961, and when a threshold of 9 was applied, the sensitivity 
and specificity of the predicting model were 100% and 88.89%, respectively. Thus,
NEAR is an effective index for predicting the severity of COVID-19 and can be
used as a powerful tool for clinicians to make better clinical decisions.
IMPORTANCE The immune inflammatory response changes rapidly with the progression 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and is 
responsible for clearance of the virus and further recovery from the infection.
However, the intensified immune and inflammatory response in the development of
the disease may lead to more serious and fatal consequences, which indicates that
immune indicators have the potential to predict serious cases. Here, we
identified both eosinophils and serum IgA as prognostic markers of COVID-19,
which sheds light on new research directions and is worthy of further research in
the scientific research field as well as clinical application. In this study, the
combination of NEU count, EOS count, and IgA level was included in a new
predictive model of the severity of COVID-19, which can be used as a powerful
tool for better clinical decision-making.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical target volume (CTV) autosegmentation for cervical cancer is
desirable for radiation therapy. Data heterogeneity and interobserver variability
(IOV) limit the clinical adaptability of such methods. The adaptive method is
proposed to improve the adaptability of CNN-based autosegmentation of CTV
contours in cervical cancer.
METHODS: This study included 400 cervical cancer treatment planning cases with
CTV delineated by radiation oncologists from three hospitals. The datasets were
divided into five subdatasets (80 cases each). The cases in datasets 1, 2, and 3 
were delineated by physicians A, B, and C, respectively. The cases in datasets 4 
and 5 were delineated by multiple physicians. Dataset 1 was divided into training
(50 cases), validation (10 cases), and testing (20 cases) cohorts, and they were 
used to construct the pretrained model. Datasets 2-5 were regarded as host
datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the pretrained model. In the adaptive
process, the pretrained model was fine-tuned to measure improvements by gradually
adding more training cases selected from the host datasets. The accuracy of the
autosegmentation model on each host dataset was evaluated using the corresponding
test cases. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff distance
(HD_95) were used to evaluate the accuracy.
RESULTS: Before and after adaptive improvements, the average DSC values on the
host datasets were 0.818 versus 0.882, 0.763 versus 0.810, 0.727 versus 0.772,
and 0.679 versus 0.789, which are improvements of 7.82%, 6.16%, 6.19%, and
16.05%, respectively. The average HD_95 values were 11.143 mm versus 6.853 mm,
22.402 mm versus 14.076 mm, 28.145 mm versus 16.437 mm, and 33.034 mm versus
16.441 mm, which are improvements of 37.94%, 37.17%, 41.60%, and 50.23%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method improved the adaptability of the CNN-based
autosegmentation model when applied to host datasets.

BACKGROUND: The aim is to quantify and analyse tumour motion during a course of
treatment for lung SBRT patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Peak-to-peak motion of 483 tumours in 441 patients treated 
with peripheral lung SBRT at a single institution over a two year period was
measured on planning CT and at all treatment fractions. Planning 4D-CT scans were
analysed using our clinical workflow involving deformable propagation of the
delineated target to all phases. Similarly, acquisition of the 4D-CBCT data
followed the clinical workflow based on XVI 5.0 available on Elekta linacs.
Differences and correlations of the peak-to-peak motion on the planning CT and at
treatment were analysed.
RESULTS: On the planning CT, a total of 81.4% of the tumours had a peak-to-peak
motion <10 mm, and 96.1% had <20 mm. The largest motion was observed in the CC
direction, with largest amplitude for tumours located in the caudal posterior
part of the lung. The difference in amplitude in CC between planning CT and first
fraction had a mean and standard deviation of 0.3 mm and 3.5 mm, respectively,
and the largest differences were observed in the caudal posterior part of the
lung. Patients with a difference in tumour motion amplitude exceeding two
standard deviations (>7 mm) at the first fraction were evaluated individually,
and they all had poor 4DCT image quality. The difference between the first and
second/third fractions had a mean and standard deviation of 0.4 mm/0.5 mm and
2.0 mm/1.9 mm.
CONCLUSION: Tumour motion at first treatment was similar to motion at planning,
and motion at subsequent treatments was very similar to motion at first
treatment. Large tumour motions are located towards the caudal posterior tumour
locations. Patients with poor 4D-CT image quality should be closely followed at
the first treatment to verify the motion.

Arab populations are largely understudied, notably their genetic structure and
history. Here we present an in-depth analysis of 6,218 whole genomes from Qatar, 
revealing extensive diversity as well as genetic ancestries representing the main
founding Arab genealogical lineages of Qahtanite (Peninsular Arabs) and Adnanite 
(General Arabs and West Eurasian Arabs). We find that Peninsular Arabs are the
closest relatives of ancient hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers from the
Levant, and that founder Arab populations experienced multiple splitting events
12-20 kya, consistent with the aridification of Arabia and farming in the Levant,
giving rise to settler and nomadic communities. In terms of recent genetic flow, 
we show that these ancestries contributed significantly to European, South Asian 
as well as South American populations, likely as a result of Islamic expansion
over the past 1400 years. Notably, we characterize a large cohort of men with the
ChrY J1a2b haplogroup (n = 1,491), identifying 29 unique sub-haplogroups.
Finally, we leverage genotype novelty to build a reference panel of 12,432
haplotypes, demonstrating improved genotype imputation for both rare and common
alleles in Arabs and the wider Middle East.

AIMS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with curative-intent radiotherapy 
at the National Cancer Institute of Sri Lanka to determine the impact of the
treatment technique on disease-free survival (DFS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: SCCHN patients treated with radical radiotherapy or
adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy from 2016 to 2017 were included in the study.
Data on the following variables were collected by reviewing clinical and
radiotherapy treatment records: age, gender, tumour site, stage, time to delivery
of radiotherapy, use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, use of concurrent
radiosensitising chemotherapy and treatment technique. DFS, defined as the time
to death, tumour recurrence or loss to follow-up, was the primary end point and
outcomes were compared between patients treated with intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) in linear accelerators and those treated with conventional
radiotherapy in cobalt teletherapy units. Univariate and multivariate analyses
were carried out on known prognostic variables.
RESULTS: In total, 408 patients were included in the study, with 138 (34%) being 
treated with IMRT in the linear accelerator. More than 75% of patients were of
stage III or IV at diagnosis. The 2-year DFS of the whole cohort was 25% (95%
confidence interval 21-30%). Patients treated with IMRT in the linear accelerator
had a superior DFS in comparison with those treated with conventional
radiotherapy in the cobalt teletherapy units (P < 0.001, hazard ratio 0.64, 95%
confidence interval 0.5-0.82). Higher stage, cobalt treatment and use of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy were adversely associated with DFS on multivariate
analysis.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of patients with SCCHN treated with
curative-intent radiotherapy in Sri Lanka had locally advanced disease and DFS
was superior in patients treated with IMRT in the linear accelerator.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Alcohol consumption has been reported to impair the physical
and mental health of the elderly. This study aimed to explore the association
between alcohol consumption patterns in midlife and cognition in the elderly
among the Chinese population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Study subjects were individuals aged ≥45 years in the shared
database of the China Health and Nutrition Survey in 1997, who were followed up
in 2006. A questionnaire was used to collect information about alcohol
consumption (frequency, amount and type). Alcohol consumption (grams/week) was
classified into none, light (≤84), light-to-moderate (84.01-168),
moderate-to-heavy (168.01-336) and heavy (≥336.01) categories in men, and none,
light (<42) and moderate (≥42) categories in women. Cognitive function was
measured in 2006 using a subset of items from the modified Telephone Interview
for Cognitive Status. The lowest quintile was used as the cut-off point for
cognitive impairment. A multivariate logistic regression model was applied. The
study involved 1926 participants with a mean age of 56.91 years, and men
accounted for 51.66% of the total participants. Drinking behaviours and cognitive
scores had significant sexual difference (P < 0.001). Cognitive impairment was
identified in 135 men and 237 women. Compared with light drinking, heavy drinking
and non-drinking were associated with cognitive impairment in men [adjusted odds 
ratio (aOR) and 95% CI were 2.19 (1.59-3.00), 1.54 (1.21-1.96), respectively;
P < 0.001]. Compared with light drinkers, female non-drinkers and moderate
drinkers were associated with cognitive impairment [aOR and 95% CI were 1.54
(1.16-2.03) and 1.75 (1.08-2.85), respectively; P < 0.001].
CONCLUSIONS: Scientific evidence on the adverse effects of heavy drinking on
elderly cognition and the possibly protective effects of light drinking could
influence policy decisions on alcohol consumption in China.

BACKGROUND: Spatial allocation of medical resources is closely related to
people's health. Thus, it is important to evaluate the abundance of medical
resources regionally and explore the spatial heterogeneity of medical resource
allocation.
METHODS: Using medical geographic big data, this study analyzed 369 Chinese
cities and constructed a medical resource evaluation model based on the grading
of medical institutions using the Delphi method. It evaluated China's medical
resources at three levels (economic sectors, economic zones, and provinces) and
discussed their spatial clustering patterns. Geographically weighted regression
was used to explore the correlations between the evaluation results and
population and gross domestic product (GDP).
RESULTS: The spatial heterogeneity of medical resource allocation in China was
significant, and the following general regularities were observed: 1) The
abundance and balance of medical resources were typically better in the east than
in the west, and in coastal areas compared to inland ones. 2) The average primacy
ratio of medical resources in Chinese cities by province was 2.30. The spatial
distribution of medical resources in the provinces was unbalanced, showing high
concentrations in the primate cities. 3) The allocation of medical resources at
the provincial level in China was summarized as following a single-growth pole
pattern supplemented by bipolar circular allocation and balanced allocation
patterns. The agglomeration patterns of medical resources in typical cities were 
categorized into single-center and balanced development patterns. GDP was highly 
correlated to the medical evaluation results, while demographic factors showed,
low correlations. Large cities and their surrounding areas exhibited obvious
response characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide policy-relevant guidance for improving the
spatial imbalance of medical resources, strengthening regional public health
systems, and promoting government coordination efforts for medical resource
allocation at different levels to improve the overall functioning of the medical 
and health service system and bolster its balanced and synergistic development.

INTRODUCTION: Umbilical hernia repair, despite its perceived simplicity, is
associated with recurrence between 2.7 and 27%, in mesh repair and non mesh
repair respectively. Many factors are recognized contributors to recurrence
however multiple defects in the linea alba, known to occur in up to 30% of
patients, appear to have been overlooked by surgeons.
AIMS: This systematic review assessed reporting of second or multiple linea alba 
defects in patients undergoing umbilical hernia repair to establish if these
anatomical variations could contribute to recurrence along with other potential
factors.
METHODS: A systematic review of all published English language articles was
undertaken using databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library
from January 2014 to 2019. The search terms 'Umbilical hernia' AND 'repair' AND
'recurrence' were used across all databases. Analysis was specified in advance to
avoid selection bias, was registered with PROSPERO (154173) and adhered to PRISMA
statement.
RESULTS: Six hundred and forty-six initial papers were refined to 10 following
article review and grading. The presence of multiple linea alba defects as a
contributor to recurrence was not reported in the literature. One paper mentioned
the exclusion of six participants from their study due multiple defects. In all
11 factors were significantly associated with umbilical hernia recurrence. These 
included: large defect, primary closure without mesh, high BMI in 5/10
publications; smoking, diabetes mellitus, surgical site Infection (SSI) and
concurrent hernia in 3/10. In addition, the type of mesh, advanced age, liver
disease and non-closure of the defect were identified in individual papers.
CONCLUSION: This study identified many factors already known to contribute to
umbilical hernia recurrence in adults, but the existence of multiple defects in
the linea, despite it prevalence, has evaded investigators. Surgeons need to be
consider documentation of this potential confounder which may contribute to
recurrence.

University, Wuhan 430079, China.

In recent years, massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received widespread
attention owing to their flexibility and free access, which has attracted
millions of online learners to participate in courses. With the wide application 
of MOOCs in educational institutions, a large amount of learners' log data exist 
in the MOOCs platform, and this lays a solid data foundation for exploring
learners' online learning behaviors. Using data mining techniques to process
these log data and then analyze the relationship between learner behavior and
academic performance has become a hot topic of research. Firstly, this paper
summarizes the commonly used predictive models in the relevant research fields.
Based on the behavior log data of learners participating in 12 courses in MOOCs, 
an entropy-based indicator quantifying behavior change trends is proposed, which 
explores the relationships between behavior change trends and learners' academic 
performance. Next, we build a set of behavioral features, which further analyze
the relationships between behaviors and academic performance. The results
demonstrate that entropy has a certain correlation with the corresponding
behavior, which can effectively represent the change trends of behavior. Finally,
to verify the effectiveness and importance of the predictive features, we choose 
four benchmark models to predict learners' academic performance and compare them 
with the previous relevant research results. The results show that the proposed
feature selection-based model can effectively identify the key features and
obtain good prediction performance. Furthermore, our prediction results are
better than the related studies in the performance prediction based on the same
Xuetang MOOC platform, which demonstrates that the combination of the selected
learner-related features (behavioral features + behavior entropy) can lead to a
much better prediction performance.

This paper proposes a screen-shooting resilient watermarking scheme via learned
invariant keypoints and QT; that is, if the watermarked image is displayed on the
screen and captured by a camera, the watermark can be still extracted from the
photo. A screen-shooting resilient watermarking algorithm should meet the
following two basic requirements: robust keypoints and a robust watermark
algorithm. In our case, we embedded watermarks by combining the feature region
filtering model to SuperPoint (FRFS) neural networks, quaternion discrete Fourier
transform (QDFT), and tensor decomposition (TD). First we applied FRFS to locate 
the embedding feature regions which are decided by the keypoints that survive
screen-shooting. Second, we structured watermark embedding regions centered at
keypoints. Third, the watermarks were embedded by the QDFT and TD (QT) algorithm,
which is robust for capturing process attacks. In a partial shooting scenario,
the watermark is repeatedly embedded into different regions in an image to
enhance robustness. Finally, we extracted the watermarks from at least one region
at the extraction stage. The experimental results showed that the proposed scheme
is very robust for camera shooting (including partial shooting) different
shooting scenarios, and special attacks. Moreover, the efficient mechanism of
screen-shooting resilient watermarking could have propietary protection and leak 
tracing applications.

The territory of the Republic of Serbia is vulnerable to various natural
disasters, among which forest fires stand out. In relation with climate changes, 
the number of forest fires in Serbia has been increasing from year to year.
Protected natural areas are especially endangered by wildfires. For Nature Park
Golija, as the second largest in Serbia, with an area of 75,183 ha, and with MaB 
Reserve Golija-Studenica on part of its territory (53,804 ha), more attention
should be paid in terms of forest fire mitigation. GIS and multi-criteria
decision analysis are indispensable when it comes to spatial analysis for the
purpose of natural disaster risk management. Index-based and fuzzy AHP methods
were used, together with TOPSIS method for forest fire susceptibility zonation.
Very high and high forest fire susceptibility zone were recorded on 26.85%
(Forest Fire Susceptibility Index) and 25.75% (fuzzy AHP). The additional support
for forest fire prevention is realized through an additional Internet of Thing
(IoT)-based sensor network that enables the continuous collection of local
meteorological and environmental data, which enables low-cost and reliable
real-time fire risk assessment and detection and the improved long-term and
short-term forest fire susceptibility assessment. Obtained results can be applied
for adequate forest fire risk management, improvement of the monitoring, and
early warning systems in the Republic of Serbia, but are also important for
relevant authorities at national, regional, and local level, which will be able
to coordinate and intervene in a case of emergency events.

One of the most dangerous kinds of attacks affecting computers is a distributed
denial of services (DDoS) attack. The main goal of this attack is to bring the
targeted machine down and make their services unavailable to legal users. This
can be accomplished mainly by directing many machines to send a very large number
of packets toward the specified machine to consume its resources and stop it from
working. We implemented a method using Java based on entropy and sequential
probabilities ratio test (ESPRT) methods to identify malicious flows and their
switch interfaces that aid them in passing through. Entropy (E) is the first
technique, and the sequential probabilities ratio test (SPRT) is the second
technique. The entropy method alone compares its results with a certain threshold
in order to make a decision. The accuracy and F-scores for entropy results thus
changed when the threshold values changed. Using both entropy and SPRT removed
the uncertainty associated with the entropy threshold. The false positive rate
was also reduced when combining both techniques. Entropy-based detection methods 
divide incoming traffic into groups of traffic that have the same size. The size 
of these groups is determined by a parameter called window size. The Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) 1998, DARPA2000, and Canadian Institute
for Cybersecurity (CIC-DDoS2019) databases were used to evaluate the
implementation of this method. The metric of a confusion matrix was used to
compare the ESPRT results with the results of other methods. The accuracy and
f-scores for the DARPA 1998 dataset were 0.995 and 0.997, respectively, for the
ESPRT method when the window size was set at 50 and 75 packets. The detection
rate of ESPRT for the same dataset was 0.995 when the window size was set to 10
packets. The average accuracy for the DARPA 2000 dataset for ESPRT was 0.905, and
the detection rate was 0.929. Finally, ESPRT was scalable to a multiple domain
topology application.

The literature on coronaviruses counts more than 300,000 publications. Finding
relevant papers concerning arbitrary queries is essential to discovery helpful
knowledge. Current best information retrieval (IR) use deep learning approaches
and need supervised training sets with labeled data, namely to know a priori the 
queries and their corresponding relevant papers. Creating such labeled datasets
is time-expensive and requires prominent experts' efforts, resources
insufficiently available under a pandemic time pressure. We present a new
self-supervised solution, called SUBLIMER, that does not require labels to learn 
to search on corpora of scientific papers for most relevant against arbitrary
queries. SUBLIMER is a novel efficient IR engine trained on the unsupervised
COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD19), using deep metric learning. The core
point of our self-supervised approach is that it uses no labels, but exploits the
bibliography citations from papers to create a latent space where their spatial
proximity is a metric of semantic similarity; for this reason, it can also be
applied to other domains of papers corpora. SUBLIMER, despite is self-supervised,
outperforms the Precision@5 (P@5) and Bpref of the state-of-the-art competitors
on CORD19, which, differently from our approach, require both labeled datasets
and a number of trainable parameters that is an order of magnitude higher than
our.

Preventive Medicine of the Medical University of Lodz, Żeligowskiego 7/9, 90-752 
Lodz, Poland.

The aim of the study was to assess mortality trends due to road traffic accidents
in Poland between 1999 and 2018. The study material was a database including
7,582,319 death certificates of all inhabitants of Poland who died in the
analyzed period (104,652 people died of transport accidents). Crude deaths rates 
(CDR), standardized death rates (SDR) and joinpoint models were used. Annual
percentage change (APC) for each segment of broken lines and average annual
percentage change (AAPC) for the whole study period were calculated. CDR
decreased from 19.7 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 9.6 per 100,000 population 
in 2018; APC was -4.1% (p < 0.05) while SDR decreased from 20.9 to 10.9 per
100,000; APC was -4.1% (p < 0.05). Large differences in traffic accident-related 
mortality were observed between men and women. An analysis by gender and age
shows that the decline in the number of deaths due to traffic accidents has been 
slowed down in the oldest age group, 65+, in both males and females. There is a
need for in-depth analyses aimed at introducing effective preventive solutions in
the field of road traffic safety in Poland. Legal regulations should particularly
refer to the most endangered groups of road users.

BACKGROUND: Palliative care is a priority for health systems worldwide, yet
equity in access remains unknown. To shed light on this issue, this study
compares populations' driving time to specialized palliative care services in
three countries: Ireland, Spain, and Switzerland.
METHODS: Network analysis of the population's driving time to services according 
to geolocated palliative care services using Geographical Information System
(GIS). Percentage of the population living within a 30-min driving time, between 
30 and 60 minutes, and over 60 min were calculated.
RESULTS: The percentage of the population living less than thirty minutes away
from the nearest palliative care provider varies among Ireland (84%), Spain
(79%), and Switzerland (95%). Percentages of the population over an hour away
from services were 1.87% in Spain, 0.58% in Ireland, and 0.51% in Switzerland.
CONCLUSION: Inequities in access to specialized palliative care are noticeable
amongst countries, with implications also at the sub-national level.

Effective multilingual communication of authoritative health information plays an
important role in helping to reduce health disparities and inequalities in
developed and developing countries. Health information communication from the
World Health Organization is governed by key principles including health
information relevance, credibility, understandability, actionability,
accessibility. Multilingual health information developed under these principles
provide valuable benchmarks to assess the quality of health resources developed
by local health authorities. In this paper, we developed machine learning
classifiers for health professionals with or without Chinese proficiency to
assess public-oriented health information in Chinese based on the definition of
effective health communication by the WHO. We compared our optimized classifier
(SVM_F5) with the state-of-art Chinese readability classifier (Chinese
Readability Index Explorer CRIE 3.0), and classifiers adapted from established
English readability formula, Gunning Fog Index, Automated Readability Index. Our 
optimized classifier achieved statistically significant higher area under the
receiver operator curve (AUC of ROC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than
those of SVM using CRIE 3.0 features and SVM using linguistic features of Gunning
Fog Index and Automated Readability Index (ARI). The statistically improved
performance of our optimized classifier compared to that of SVM classifiers
adapted from popular readability formula suggests that evaluation of health
communication effectiveness as defined by the principles of the WHO is more
complex than information readability assessment. Our SVM classifier validated on 
health information covering diverse topics (environmental health, infectious
diseases, pregnancy, maternity care, non-communicable diseases, tobacco control) 
can aid effectively in the automatic assessment of original, translated Chinese
public health information of whether they satisfy or not the current
international standard of effective health communication as set by the WHO.

Since 2015, the UK has resettled over 25,000 refugees. To support resettlement
and integration, refugees undergo a pre-arrival medical health assessment (MHA), 
which is used for healthcare planning by local government in England. This study 
aimed to understand the utility and effectiveness of the MHA and flow of data to 
support resettlement planning. Seven local government representatives were
interviewed regarding their experiences and perceptions of the refugee health
information system (HIS) and the MHA for resettlement in England. Data was
analyzed using thematic analysis. The three themes indicated that the HIS was
perceived to be effective, however, issues on governance, timeliness of
information and access were identified. Findings showed that for the MHA to be
more useful for planning, assessments for mental health issues and child special 
educational needs (SEN) are needed. Findings also indicated resettlement promoted
joint working and acceptability of refugee resettlement. In areas where data
sharing and governance processes are well defined, the HIS is effective and the
MHA supports resettlement. National agencies should put structures in place to
support timely health information flow.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spreads from one person to another rapidly. A
recently discovered coronavirus causes it. COVID-19 has proven to be challenging 
to detect and cure at an early stage all over the world. Patients showing
symptoms of COVID-19 are resulting in hospitals becoming overcrowded, which is
becoming a significant challenge. Deep learning's contribution to big data
medical research has been enormously beneficial, offering new avenues and
possibilities for illness diagnosis techniques. To counteract the COVID-19
outbreak, researchers must create a classifier distinguishing between positive
and negative corona-positive X-ray pictures. In this paper, the Apache Spark
system has been utilized as an extensive data framework and applied a Deep
Transfer Learning (DTL) method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) three
architectures -InceptionV3, ResNet50, and VGG19-on COVID-19 chest X-ray images.
The three models are evaluated in two classes, COVID-19 and normal X-ray images, 
with 100 percent accuracy. But in COVID/Normal/pneumonia, detection accuracy was 
97 percent for the inceptionV3 model, 98.55 percent for the ResNet50 Model, and
98.55 percent for the VGG19 model, respectively.

The Citrus genus comprises some of the most important and commonly cultivated
fruit plants. Within the last decade, citrus greening disease (also known as
huanglongbing or HLB) has emerged as the biggest threat for the citrus industry. 
This disease does not have a cure yet and, thus, many efforts have been made to
find a solution to this devastating condition. There are challenges in the
generation of high-yield resistant cultivars, in part due to the limited and
sparse knowledge about the mechanisms that are used by the Liberibacter bacteria 
to proliferate the infection in Citrus plants. Here, we present GreeningDB, a
database implemented to provide the annotation of Liberibacter proteomes, as well
as the host-pathogen comparactomics tool, a novel platform to compare the
predicted interactomes of two HLB host-pathogen systems. GreeningDB is built to
deliver a user-friendly interface, including network visualization and links to
other resources. We hope that by providing these characteristics, GreeningDB can 
become a central resource to retrieve HLB-related protein annotations, and thus, 
aid the community that is pursuing the development of molecular-based strategies 
to mitigate this disease's impact. The database is freely available at
http://bioinfo.usu.edu/GreeningDB/ (accessed on 11 August 2021).

Bisphenols are important environmental pollutants that are extensively studied
due to different detrimental effects, while the molecular mechanisms behind these
effects are less well understood. Like other environmental pollutants, bisphenols
are being tested in various experimental models, creating large expression
datasets found in open access storage. The meta-analysis of such datasets is,
however, very complicated for various reasons. Here, we developed an integrating 
statistical and machine-learning model approach for the meta-analysis of
bisphenol A (BPA) exposure datasets from different mouse tissues. We constructed 
three joint datasets following three different strategies for dataset
integration: in particular, using all common genes from the datasets,
uncorrelated, and not co-expressed genes, respectively. By applying machine
learning methods to these datasets, we identified genes whose expression was
significantly affected in all of the BPA microanalysis data tested; those
involved in the regulation of cell survival include: Tnfr2, Hgf-Met, Agtr1a,
Bdkrb2; signaling through Mapk8 (Jnk1)); DNA repair (Hgf-Met, Mgmt); apoptosis
(Tmbim6, Bcl2, Apaf1); and cellular junctions (F11r, Cldnd1, Ctnd1 and Yes1). Our
results highlight the benefit of combining existing datasets for the integrated
analysis of a specific topic when individual datasets are limited in size.

Despite recent advances in therapies including immunotherapy, patients with acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML) still experience relatively poor survival rates. The
Inhibition of Apoptosis (IAP) family member, survivin, also known by its gene and
protein name, Baculoviral IAP Repeat Containing 5 (BIRC5), remains one of the
most frequently expressed antigens across AML subtypes. To better understand its 
potential to act as a target for immunotherapy and a biomarker for AML survival, 
we examined the protein and pathways that BIRC5 interacts with using the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), search tool for recurring instances of 
neighbouring genes (STRING), WEB-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit, Bloodspot and
performed a comprehensive literature review. We then analysed data from gene
expression studies. These included 312 AML samples in the Microarray Innovations 
In Leukemia (MILE) dataset. We found a trend between above median levels of BIRC5
being associated with improved overall survival (OS) but this did not reach
statistical significance (p = 0.077, Log-Rank). There was some evidence of a
beneficial effect in adjusted analyses where above median levels of BIRC5 were
shown to be associated with improved OS (p = 0.001) including in Core Binding
Factor (CBF) patients (p = 0.03). Above median levels of BIRC5 transcript were
associated with improved relapse free survival (p < 0.0001). Utilisation of a
second large cDNA microarray dataset including 306 AML cases, again showed no
correlation between BIRC5 levels and OS, but high expression levels of BIRC5
correlated with worse survival in inv(16) patients (p = 0.077) which was highly
significant when datasets A and B were combined (p = 0.001). In addition,
decreased BIRC5 expression was associated with better clinical outcome (p =
0.004) in AML patients exhibiting CBF mainly due to patients with inv(16) (p =
0.007). This study has shown that BIRC5 expression plays a role in the survival
of AML patients, this association is not apparent when we examine CBF patients as
a cohort, but when those with inv(16) independently indicating that those
patients with inv(16) would provide interesting candidates for immunotherapies
that target BIRC5.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain tumor in
adults. Radiotherapy has long been an important treatment method of GBM. However,
the intrinsic radioresistance of GBM cells is a key reason of poor therapeutic
efficiency. Recently, many studies have shown that using the histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in radiotherapy may
improve the prognosis of GBM patients, but the underlying molecular mechanisms
remain unclear. In this study, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE153982
and GSE131956 were analyzed to evaluate radiation-induced changes of gene
expression in GBM without or with SAHA treatment, respectively. Additionally, the
survival-associated genes of GBM patients were screened using the Chinese Glioma 
Genome Atlas (CGGA) database. Taking the intersection of these three datasets, 11
survival-associated genes were discovered to be activated by irradiation and
regulated by SAHA. The expressions of these genes were further verified in human 
GBM cell lines U251, T98G, and U251 homologous radioresistant cells (U251R) by
reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). It was
found that MMP14 mRNA was considerably highly expressed in the radioresistant
cell lines and was reduced by SAHA treatment. Transfection of MMP14 siRNA
(siMMP14) suppressed cell survivals of these GBM cells after irradiation. Taken
together, our results reveal for the first time that the MMP14 gene contributed
to SAHA-induced radiosensitization of GBM.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated by the
back-splicing of exons from linear precursor mRNAs. Though various linear RNAs
have been shown to play important regulatory roles in many biological and
developmental processes, little is known about the role of their circular
counterparts. In this study, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing to
delineate the expression profile and potential function of circRNAs during the
five stages of pollen development in Brassica rapa. A total of 1180 circRNAs were
detected in pollen development, of which 367 showed stage-specific expression
patterns. Functional enrichment and metabolic pathway analysis showed that the
parent genes of circRNAs were mainly involved in pollen-related molecular and
biological processes such as mitotic and meiotic cell division, DNA processes,
protein synthesis, protein modification, and polysaccharide biosynthesis.
Moreover, by predicting the circRNA-miRNA network from our differentially
expressed circRNAs, we found 88 circRNAs with potential miRNA binding sites,
suggesting their role in post-transcriptional regulation of the genes. Finally,
we confirmed the back-splicing sites of nine selected circRNAs using divergent
primers and Sanger sequencing. Our study presents the systematic analysis of
circular RNAs during pollen development and forms the basis of future studies for
unlocking complex gene regulatory networks underpinning reproduction in flowering
plants.

How herbivorous insects adapt to host plants is a key question in ecological and 
evolutionary biology. The fall armyworm, (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.
Smith), although polyphagous and a major pest on various crops, has been reported
to have a rice and corn (maize) feeding strain in its native range in the
Americas. The species is highly invasive and has recently established in China.
We compared behavioral changes in larvae and adults of a corn population (Corn)
when selected on rice (Rice) and the molecular basis of these adaptational
changes in midgut and antennae based on a comparative transcriptome analysis.
Larvae of S. frugiperda reared on rice plants continuously for 20 generations
exhibited strong feeding preference for with higher larval performance and pupal 
weight on rice than on maize plants. Similarly, females from the rice selected
population laid significantly more eggs on rice as compared to females from maize
population. The most highly expressed DEGs were shown in the midgut of Rice vs.
Corn. A total of 6430 DEGs were identified between the populations mostly in
genes related to digestion and detoxification. These results suggest that
potential adaptations for feeding on rice crops, may contribute to the current
rapid spread of fall armyworm on rice crops in China and potentially elsewhere.
Consistently, highly expressed DEGs were also shown in antennae; a total of 5125 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) s were identified related to the expansions
of major chemosensory genes family in Rice compared to the Corn feeding
population. These results not only provide valuable insight into the molecular
mechanisms in host plants adaptation of S. frugiperda but may provide new gene
targets for the management of this pest.

With the massive use of plastic products, plastic pollution has increasingly
attracted worldwide attention. To deal with the problem of plastic pollution, the
Chinese government issued the "Opinions on Further Strengthening the Control of
Plastic Pollution" (Abbreviated as OFSCPP), which is known as "plastic
restriction policy" by the public, in January 2020. It stipulates the timetable
and main tasks for restricting the production, sales, and use of certain plastic 
products, such as plastic bags, disposable straws and agricultural mulch. Since
the policy was officially implemented on January 1, 2021, people's lives in China
have been considerably affected, and it has also attracted widespread attention
from news media. In this study, 310 pieces of news items and information about
the OFSCPP published in the first quarter of 2021 from the Baidu News website
from which 44, 94, 90, 26, and 49 statements from producers, retailers,
consumers, managers, and experts were extracted. The extracted words and
expressions were then analyzed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model.
Text analysis results showed that the production efficiency of plastic
substitutes in China cannot meet market demand, consumers' experience on plastic 
substitutes is poor, and recycling and disposal processing information is opaque.
To achieve the policy goals, the government should encourage the innovation of
high-quality and inexpensive plastic alternatives, the national standards for
plastic substitutes should be urgently improved, consumers' concept of green
consumption should be gradually cultivated, and terminal recycling and disposal
should be promoted.

Illegal wildlife trade is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity.
Understanding its economic value is a first step to establishing the magnitude of
the problem. We develop a dataset of illegal wildlife trade prices and combine it
with seizure data to estimate the economic value of illegal wildlife trade
entering the USA. Using 2013 as a reference year, the results reveal that the
economic value of illegal wildlife trade entering the USA was, using a
conservative scenario where potential outliers were excluded, US$3.2 billion/year
(uncertainty range (UR) 5th and 95th percentile of US$0.6-8.2 billion/year) and, 
without excluding potential outliers, US$4.3 billion/year (UR of US$1.3-9.6
billion/year). Our results for the USA alone are of a comparable magnitude to the
lower bound of commonly used global estimates of the economic value of IWT of
uncertain origin, suggesting that the global economic value of IWT is currently
underestimated and requires an urgent revision.

Formation of mature miRNAs and their expression is a highly controlled process.
It is very much dependent upon the post-transcriptional regulatory events. Recent
findings suggest that several RNA binding proteins beyond Drosha/Dicer are
involved in the processing of miRNAs. Deciphering of conditional networks for
these RBP-miRNA interactions may help to reason the spatio-temporal nature of
miRNAs which can also be used to predict miRNA profiles. In this direction, >25TB
of data from different platforms were studied (CLIP-seq/RNA-seq/miRNA-seq) to
develop Bayesian causal networks capable of reasoning miRNA biogenesis. The
networks ably explained the miRNA formation when tested across a large number of 
conditions and experimentally validated data. The networks were modeled into an
XGBoost machine learning system where expression information of the network
components was found capable to quantitatively explain the miRNAs formation
levels and their profiles. The models were developed for 1,204 human miRNAs whose
accurate expression level could be detected directly from the RNA-seq data alone 
without any need of doing separate miRNA profiling experiments like miRNA-seq or 
arrays. A first of its kind, miRbiom performed consistently well with high
average accuracy (91%) when tested across a large number of experimentally
established data from several conditions. It has been implemented as an
interactive open access web-server where besides finding the profiles of miRNAs, 
their downstream functional analysis can also be done. miRbiom will help to get
an accurate prediction of human miRNAs profiles in the absence of profiling
experiments and will be an asset for regulatory research areas. The study also
shows the importance of having RBP interaction information in better
understanding the miRNAs and their functional projectiles where it also lays the 
foundation of such studies and software in future.

Predicting PY motif-mediated protein-protein interactions in the Nedd4 family of 
ubiquitin ligases.

Hatstat AK(1), Pupi MD(1), McCafferty DG(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Chemistry, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, United
States of America.

The Nedd4 family contains several structurally related but functionally distinct 
HECT-type ubiquitin ligases. The members of the Nedd4 family are known to
recognize substrates through their multiple WW domains, which recognize PY motifs
(PPxY, LPxY) or phospho-threonine or phospho-serine residues. To better
understand protein interactor recognition mechanisms across the Nedd4 family, we 
report the development and implementation of a python-based tool, PxYFinder, to
identify PY motifs in the primary sequences of previously identified interactors 
of Nedd4 and related ligases. Using PxYFinder, we find that, on average, half of 
Nedd4 family interactions are likely PY-motif mediated. Further, we find that
PPxY motifs are more prevalent than LPxY motifs and are more likely to occur in
proline-rich regions and that PPxY regions are more disordered on average
relative to LPxY-containing regions. Informed by consensus sequences for PY
motifs across the Nedd4 interactome, we rationally designed a focused peptide
library and employed a computational screen, revealing sequence- and biomolecular
interaction-dependent determinants of WW-domain/PY-motif interactions.
Cumulatively, our efforts provide a new bioinformatic tool and expand our
understanding of sequence and structural factors that contribute to PY-motif
mediated interactor recognition across the Nedd4 family.

Access to online information has been crucial throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
We analyzed more than eight million randomly selected Twitter posts from the
first wave of the pandemic to study the role of the author's social status
(Health Expert or Influencer) and the informational novelty of the tweet in the
diffusion of several key types of information. Our results show that
health-related information and political discourse propagated faster than
personal narratives, economy-related or travel-related news. Content novelty
further accelerated the spread of these discussion themes. People trusted health 
experts on health-related knowledge, especially when it was novel, while
influencers were more effective at propagating political discourse. Finally, we
observed a U-shaped relationship between the informational novelty and the number
of retweets. Tweets with average novelty spread the least. Tweets with high
novelty propagated the most, primarily when they discussed political, health, or 
personal information, perhaps owing to the immediacy to mobilize this
information. On the other hand, economic and travel-related information spread
most when it was less novel, and people resisted sharing such information before 
it was duly verified.

Domestic ducks are raised for meat, eggs and feather down, and almost all
varieties are descended from the Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). Here, we report
chromosome-level high-quality genome assemblies for meat and laying duck breeds, 
and the Mallard. Our new genomic databases contain annotations for thousands of
new protein-coding genes and recover a major percentage of the presumed "missing 
genes" in birds. We obtain the entire genomic sequences for the C-type lectin
(CTL) family members that regulate eggshell biomineralization. Our population and
comparative genomics analyses provide more than 36 million sequence variants
between duck populations. Furthermore, a mutant cell line allows confirmation of 
the predicted anti-adipogenic function of NR2F2 in the duck, and uncovered
mutations specific to Pekin duck that potentially affect adipose deposition. Our 
study provides insights into avian evolution and the genetics of oviparity, and
will be a rich resource for the future genetic improvement of commercial traits
in the duck.

OBJECTIVES: Computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems facilitate the
review of medication orders by pharmacists. Reports have emerged that show
conception flaws or the misuse of CPOE systems generate prescribing errors. We
aimed to characterise pharmacist interventions (PIs) triggered by prescribing
errors identified as system-related errors (PISREs) in French hospitals.
DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional observational study based on PIs prospectively
documented in the Act-IP observatory database from January 2014 to December 2018.
SETTING: PISREs from 319 French computerised healthcare facilities were analysed.
PARTICIPANTS: Among the 319 French hospitals, 232 (72.7%) performed SRE
interventions, involving 652 (51%) pharmacists.
RESULTS: Among the 331 678 PIs recorded, 27 058 were qualified as due to SREs
(8.2%). The main drug-related problems associated with PISREs were
supratherapeutic (27.5%) and subtherapeutic dosage (17.2%), non-conformity with
guidelines/contraindications (22.4%) and improper administration (17.9%). The PI 
prescriber acceptation rate was 78.9% for SREs vs 67.6% for other types of
errors. The PISRE ratio was estimated relative to the total number of PIs.
Concerning the certification status of CPOE systems, the PISRE ratio was 9.4% for
non-certified systems vs 5.5% for certified systems (p<0.001). The PISRE ratio
for senior pharmacists was 9.2% and that for pharmacy residents 5.4% (p<0.001).
Concerning prescriptions made by graduate prescribers and those made by
residents, the PISRE ratio was 8.4% and 7.8%, respectively (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Computer-related prescribing errors are common. The PI acceptance
rate by prescribers was higher than that observed for PIs that were not CPOE
related. This suggests that physicians consider the potential clinical
consequences of SREs for patients to be more frequently serious than
interventions unrelated to CPOE. CPOE medication review requires continual
pharmacist diligence to catch these errors. The significantly lower PISRE ratio
for certified software should prompt patient safety agencies to undertake studies
to identify the safest software and discard software that is potentially
dangerous.

BACKGROUND: The medication process is complex and error-prone. To avoid
medication errors, a medication order should fulfil certain criteria, such as
good readability and comprehensiveness. In this context, a computerized physician
order entry (CPOE) system can be helpful. This study aims to investigate the
distinct effects on the quality of prescription documentation of a CPOE system
implemented on general wards in a large tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, the prescriptions of two groups of 160
patients each were evaluated, with data collected before and after the
introduction of a CPOE system. According to nationally available recommendations 
on prescription documentation, it was assessed whether each prescription
fulfilled the established 20 criteria for a safe, complete, and actionable
prescription. The resulting fulfilment scores (prescription-Fscores) were
compared between the pre-implementation and the post-implementation group and a
multivariable analysis was performed to identify the effects of further
covariates, i.e., the prescription category, the ward, and the number of
concurrently prescribed drugs. Additionally, the fulfilment of the 20 criteria
was assessed at an individual criterion-level (denoted criteria-Fscores).
RESULTS: The overall mean prescription-Fscore increased from 57.4% ± 12.0%
(n = 1850 prescriptions) before to 89.8% ± 7.2% (n = 1592 prescriptions) after
the implementation (p < 0.001). At the level of individual criteria,
criteria-Fscores significantly improved in most criteria (n = 14), with 6
criteria reaching a total score of 100% after CPOE implementation. Four criteria 
showed no statistically significant difference and in two criteria,
criteria-Fscores deteriorated significantly. A multivariable analysis confirmed
the large impact of the CPOE implementation on prescription-Fscores which was
consistent when adjusting for the confounding potential of further covariates.
CONCLUSIONS: While the quality of prescription documentation generally increases 
with implementation of a CPOE system, certain criteria are difficult to fulfil
even with the help of a CPOE system. This highlights the need to accompany a CPOE
implementation with a thorough evaluation that can provide important information 
on possible improvements of the software, training needs of prescribers, or the
necessity of modifying the underlying clinical processes.

Erratum in
    BMC Cancer. 2021 Oct 26;21(1):1146.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most prevalent non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC). Patients with LUAD have a poor 5-year survival rate. The use of
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of LUAD has been on the
rise in the past decade. This study explored the prognostic role of
butyrophilin-like 9 (BTNL9) in LUAD.
METHODS: Gene expression profile of buytrophilins (BTNs) was determined using the
GEPIA database. The effect of BTNL9 on the survival of LUAD patients was assessed
using Kaplan-Meier plotter and OncoLnc. Correlation between BTNL9 expression and 
tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TILs) was explored using TIMER and GEPIA
databases. Further, the relationship between BTNL9 expression and drug response
was evaluated using CARE. Besides, construction and evaluation of nomogram based 
on BTNL9 expression and TNM stage.
RESULTS: BTNL9 expression was downregulated in LUAD and was associated with a
poor probability of 1, 3, 5-years overall survival (OS). In addition, BTNL9
expression was regulated at epigenetic and post-transcriptional modification
levels. Moreover, BTNL9 expression was significantly positively correlated with
ImmuneScore and ESTIMATEScore. Furthermore, BTNL9 expression was positively
associated with infiltration levels of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and macrophages.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that BTNL9 expression in B cells and dendritic cells
(DCs) was significantly associated with OS. BTNL9 expression was significantly
positively correlated with CARE scores.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that BTNL9 is a potential prognostic biomarker
for LUAD. Low BTNL9 expression levels associated with low infiltration levels of 
naïve B cells, and DCs in the tumor microenvironment are unfavorable for OS in
LUAD patients.

Background: Up-to-date guidance on comprehensive study identification for
systematic reviews is crucial. According to current recommendations, systematic
searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search 
methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at
collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from "seed
references". Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of
citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop
recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature
searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following
research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic
literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, 
and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for
citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping
review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological 
studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature
searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design,
language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE
(Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information
science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field. Two reviewers
will independently perform study selection. We will conduct direct backward and
forward citation tracking on included articles. Data from included studies will
be extracted using a prespecified extraction sheet and presented in both tabular 
and narrative form. The results of the scoping review will inform the subsequent 
Delphi study through which we aim to derive consensus recommendations for the
future practice and research of citation tracking.

Geological disasters seriously threaten the safety of human life, property,
ecological resources, and the environment. Effective control of geological
disasters is the focus of achieving sustainable social development. The Helong
City (Jilin Province, China) was selected as the case study. Combined with GIS
technology, a new integrated prediction model of geological disaster
susceptibility was developed to improve the accuracy of geological disaster
assessment, reduce the cost of geological disaster treatment, and ensure the
sustainable development of ecological environment. The research results showed
that elevation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were the key
factors affecting susceptibility. Compared with the conventional model, the
accuracy of the developing integrated model FR-DT and FR-RF was improved by more 
than 6%, and the disaster points were more concentrated in the high
susceptibility zone. Statistical results of disaster treatment cost estimation
and gross domestic product (GDP) value showed that the integrated model can save 
about 10% of treatment cost, and the ratio of total GDP/disaster governance cost 
was higher. The performance of the integrated model FR-DT and FR-RF had obvious
advantages over the conventional model in terms of prediction accuracy,
prevention pertinence, and prevention cost. These research results promote the
advancement of geological disaster prevention and control technology, ensure the 
safety of the geological environment, and are of great significance to the
sustainable development of the regional economy.

Detecting phishing websites using machine learning technique.

Dutta AK(1).

Author information:

Sciences, Almaarefa University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

In recent years, advancements in Internet and cloud technologies have led to a
significant increase in electronic trading in which consumers make online
purchases and transactions. This growth leads to unauthorized access to users'
sensitive information and damages the resources of an enterprise. Phishing is one
of the familiar attacks that trick users to access malicious content and gain
their information. In terms of website interface and uniform resource locator
(URL), most phishing webpages look identical to the actual webpages. Various
strategies for detecting phishing websites, such as blacklist, heuristic, Etc.,
have been suggested. However, due to inefficient security technologies, there is 
an exponential increase in the number of victims. The anonymous and
uncontrollable framework of the Internet is more vulnerable to phishing attacks. 
Existing research works show that the performance of the phishing detection
system is limited. There is a demand for an intelligent technique to protect
users from the cyber-attacks. In this study, the author proposed a URL detection 
technique based on machine learning approaches. A recurrent neural network method
is employed to detect phishing URL. Researcher evaluated the proposed method with
7900 malicious and 5800 legitimate sites, respectively. The experiments' outcome 
shows that the proposed method's performance is better than the recent approaches
in malicious URL detection.

BACKGROUND: Back pain patients are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety
and reduced quality of life. Pain drawing is a simple, frequently used anamnesis 
tool that facilitates communication between physicians and patients. This study
analysed pain drawings to examine whether pain drawing is suitable as a screening
tool for signs of anxiety, depression or reduced quality of life, as the
detection of these symptoms is essential for successful treatment.
METHODS: Pain drawings of 219 patients with lower back pain were evaluated
retrospectively. Pain drawings are a schematic drawing of a human being. Six
variables of the pain drawing were analysed. Subscales of the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the Short
Form 12 (SF-12) were used to measure anxiety, depression and quality of life,
respectively. Descriptive statistics, uni- and multivariate linear regression
analyses and analysis of variance were performed. Logistic regression analyses
were conducted for suitable variables.
RESULTS: We revealed significant positive correlations between the variables
"filled body surface" and "number of pain sites" and the anxiety (HADS-A) and
depression subscales (HADS-D) of the HADS (p<0.01). The same predictors had
significant negative correlations with the MCS (p<0.01). However, the sensitivity
and specificity of the variable "number of pain sites" were too low compared to
those for existing screening tests to consider it as a screening tool for
anxiety, depression and quality of life (HADS-A: sensitivity: 45.2%, specificity:
83.3%; HADS-D: sensitivity: 61.1%, specificity: 51%; MCS: sensitivity: 21.2%,
specificity: 85.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant correlations between the amount of filled
body surface and the number of pain sites in the pain drawing and anxiety,
depression and quality of life. Although useful in routine clinical practice,
pain drawing cannot be used as a screening tool based on our results.

Importance: Machine learning could be used to predict the likelihood of diagnosis
and severity of illness. Lack of COVID-19 patient data has hindered the data
science community in developing models to aid in the response to the pandemic.
Objectives: To describe the rapid development and evaluation of clinical
algorithms to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization using patient data
by citizen scientists, provide an unbiased assessment of model performance, and
benchmark model performance on subgroups.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic and prognostic study operated 
a continuous, crowdsourced challenge using a model-to-data approach to securely
enable the use of regularly updated COVID-19 patient data from the University of 
Washington by participants from May 6 to December 23, 2020. A postchallenge
analysis was conducted from December 24, 2020, to April 7, 2021, to assess the
generalizability of models on the cumulative data set as well as subgroups
stratified by age, sex, race, and time of COVID-19 test. By December 23, 2020,
this challenge engaged 482 participants from 90 teams and 7 countries.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Machine learning algorithms used patient data and
output a score that represented the probability of patients receiving a positive 
COVID-19 test result or being hospitalized within 21 days after receiving a
positive COVID-19 test result. Algorithms were evaluated using area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision
recall curve (AUPRC) scores. Ensemble models aggregating models from the top
challenge teams were developed and evaluated.
Results: In the analysis using the cumulative data set, the best performance for 
COVID-19 diagnosis prediction was an AUROC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.775-0.777) and an 
AUPRC of 0.297, and for hospitalization prediction, an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI,
0.794-0.798) and an AUPRC of 0.188. Analysis on top models submitting to the
challenge showed consistently better model performance on the female group than
the male group. Among all age groups, the best performance was obtained for the
25- to 49-year age group, and the worst performance was obtained for the group
aged 17 years or younger.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic and prognostic study, models
submitted by citizen scientists achieved high performance for the prediction of
COVID-19 testing and hospitalization outcomes. Evaluation of challenge models on 
demographic subgroups and prospective data revealed performance discrepancies,
providing insights into the potential bias and limitations in the models.

We analyzed the knowledge structure, current status, and future directions of
3243 publications on male osteoporosis by employing bibliometric analysis. Our
results indicated that Osteoporosis International was the most influential
journal in this field. And the study of epidemiology and risk factors has been
recognized as a hot research topic in recent years. This study also calls for
more attention to be given on male osteoporosis research.INTRODUCTION: Male
osteoporosis is increasing as a serious health problem worldwide with the aging
of population. However, a comprehensive understanding of the current status and
future trends in this field is lacking to date. The goal of the present study was
to summarize and visualize the knowledge framework, research hotspots, and
emerging trends of male osteoporosis research based on the bibliometric method.
METHODS: Scientific publications regarding male osteoporosis from 1998 to 2020
were downloaded from the SCIE database. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and online
bibliometric website were used for this study. The main analyses include
cooperative relationships between countries/institutions/authors, co-citation
analysis of authors/journals, and co-occurrence analysis of keywords/subject
categories, as well as analyses on keyword/reference bursts.
RESULTS: A total of 3243 publications with 128,751 citations were identified.
Despite experiencing a period of increase in the number of publications,
incentives for conducting male osteoporosis research seem to have decreased
during recent years. The USA has the most prominent contributions, as reflected
by most publications and the highest H-index value. Oregon Health and Science
University was the most prolific institution within this domain. The most
influential academic journal was Osteoporosis International. Keywords were
categorized into four clusters: basic research, epidemiology and risk factors,
diagnostic studies, treatment and fracture prevention. Burst keyword detection
suggested that the following research directions including "obesity," "zoledronic
acid," "DXA," "inflammation," "fall," "microarchitecture," and "sarcopenia"
remain research hotspots in the near future and deserve our further attention.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first bibliometric analysis that provides a
comprehensive overview of male osteoporosis research, which may provide helpful
references for investigators to further explore hot issues in this field.

We study the rehabilitation training of damaged parts of ice and snow sports
clock and ensure the physical safety of athletes. The results show that the RBF
neural network updates the center, weight, and width of the radial basis
function, and the predicted maximum compliance is 99%, and the minimum compliance
is 93%. After many analysis times, the prediction results show that the
difference between the predicted degree of conformity and the actual results is
less than 8%. The RBF neural network is trained according to the risk database of
sports injury, and the RBF neural network will output corresponding values to
realize sports injury estimation. The experimental results show that the designed
model has high precision and efficiency.

This work organically integrates a systematic and individualized nursing plan
with big data technology and applies it to the care of patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure (RF) and explores
the continuous care model based on modern big data technologies to improve COPD
and RF. It aims to relieve the symptoms of COPD and RF, reduce the number of
acute episodes of COPD and RF and the number of hospitalizations, and improve the
quality of life of patients. One hundred COPD and RF patients hospitalized in the
respiratory medicine department of a tertiary hospital were selected and were
categorized into control and experimental group. The nursing mode of the patients
in the control group was the original telephone follow-up in the department, and 
the contents of the follow-up were determined according to the questions of the
patients on the telephone at that time. Based on the original nursing in the
department, the experimental group adopted individualized continual nursing plans
based on the Internet and big data techniques for patients to conduct a pulmonary
rehabilitation-related functional assessment, functional exercise guidance, and
health guidance. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional
continuous care, individualized continuous care combined with big data techniques
can improve the lung function of patients with stable COPD and RF, reduce the
number of acute COPD and RF attacks and the number of readmissions, and improve
self-management ability and quality of life. The method can be applied and
implemented in continuous nursing care.

Inflammatory reaction of pulp tissue plays a role in the pathogen elimination and
tissue repair. The evaluation of severity of pulpitis can serve an instructive
function in therapeutic scheme. However, there are many limitations in the
traditional evaluation methods for the severity of pulpitis. Based on the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, our study discovered 843 differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) related to pulpitis. Afterwards, we constructed a
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs and used MCODE plugin to
determine the key functional subset. Meanwhile, genes in the key functional
subset were subjected to GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The result showed that 
genes were mainly enriched in inflammatory reaction-related functions. Next, we
screened out intersections of PPI network nodes and pulpitis-related genes. Then,
20 genes were obtained as seed genes. In the PPI network, 50 genes that had the
highest correlation with seed genes were screened out using random walk with
restart (RWR). Furthermore, 4 pulpitis-related hub genes were obtained from the
intersection of the top 50 genes and genes in the key functional subset. Finally,
GeneMANIA was utilized to predict genes coexpressed with hub genes, and
expression levels of the 4 hub genes in normal and pulpitis groups were analyzed 
based on GEO data. The result demonstrated that the 4 hub genes were mainly
coexpressed with chemokine-related genes and were remarkably upregulated in the
pulpitis group. In short, we eventually determined 4 potential biomarkers of
pulpitis.

University, Chongqing 400067, China.

A multimodal medical image fusion algorithm based on multiple latent low-rank
representation is proposed to improve imaging quality by solving fuzzy details
and enhancing the display of lesions. Firstly, the proposed method decomposes the
source image repeatedly using latent low-rank representation to obtain several
saliency parts and one low-rank part. Secondly, the VGG-19 network identifies the
low-rank part's features and generates the weight maps. Then, the fused low-rank 
part can be obtained by making the Hadamard product of the weight maps and the
source images. Thirdly, the fused saliency parts can be obtained by selecting the
max value. Finally, the fused saliency parts and low-rank part are superimposed
to obtain the fused image. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 
superior to the traditional multimodal medical image fusion algorithms in the
subjective evaluation and objective indexes.

Electric Power, Zhengzhou, Henan 450046, China.

In order to effectively optimize the machine online translation system and
improve its translation efficiency and translation quality, this study uses the
deep separable convolution neural network algorithm to construct a machine online
translation model and evaluates the quality on the basis of pseudo data learning.
In order to verify the performance of the model, the regression performance
experiment of the model, the method performance experiment of generating pseudo
data for specific tasks, the sorting task performance experiment of the model,
and the machine translation quality comparison experiment are designed. RMSE and 
MAE were used to evaluate the regression task performance of the model. Spearman 
rank correlation coefficient and delta AVG value were used to evaluate the
sorting task performance of the model. The experimental results show that the MAE
and RMSE values of the model are decreased by 2.28% and 1.39%, respectively,
compared with the baseline system under the same experimental conditions, and the
Spearman and delta AVG values are increased by 132% and 100.7%, respectively,
compared with the baseline system. The method of generating pseudo data for
specific tasks needs less data and can make the translation system reach a better
level faster. When the number of instances is more than 10, the quality score of 
the model output is higher than that of Google translation whose similarity is
more than 0.8.

Search is a verb: systematic review searching as invisible labor.

Ross-White A(1).

Library, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.

Invisible labor is a term used by labor economists to describe work that
contributes, and is often even necessary, to the economy but largely goes
unrecognized and unpaid. Despite the fact that systematic review searching is a
significant task for many librarians and knowledge professionals, the search
process can be considered a form of invisible labor because it often goes without
recognition. This occurs sometimes through not granting authorship to the
librarian who performed the intellectual contribution of search development and
sometimes through a devaluing of the search process by the choice of language
used to describe the search. By using the term search as a passive verb or noun, 
authors devalue the real intellectual labor involved in searching, which includes
decisions related to search terms and combinations, database selection, and other
search parameters. This commentary explores the context of how searching is
described through the concept of invisible labor.

Background: Prior to 2020, library orientation for first-year medical students at
Weill Cornell Medicine took the form of an on-site treasure hunt competition. Due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, the orientation for the MD class of 2024 was shifted to
an all-virtual format. This shift mandated a full redesign of the library
orientation.
Case Presentation: The Samuel J. Wood Library sought to preserve the excitement
and fun of the treasure hunt in the new virtual format. The competition was
redesigned as a Zoom meeting using breakout rooms, with library faculty and staff
serving as team facilitators. Tasks were rewritten, shifting the focus from the
library's physical spaces to its virtual services and online resources. The
redesigned orientation was evaluated using two data sources: a postsession survey
of student participants and a debriefing of the library employees who
participated. Student evaluations were positive, while the faculty and staff
provided numerous suggestions for improving future virtual orientations.
Conclusions: A successful virtual library orientation requires careful
preparation, including testing the competition tasks, full rehearsal with library
facilitators, and a thoughtful approach to technology and logistics. We have
chosen to share the materials we developed for other academic health sciences
libraries that may wish to take a similar approach to their own virtual
orientations.

Objective: This study aims to identify the core journals cited in the health care
management literature and to determine their coverage in the foremost
bibliographic databases used by the discipline.
Methods: Using the methodology outlined by the Medical Library Association's
Nursing and Allied Health Resource Section (NAHRS) protocol for "Mapping the
Literature of Nursing and Allied Health Professions," this study updates an
earlier study published in 2007. Cited references from articles published in a
three-year range (2016-2018) were collected from five health care management
journals. Using Bradford's Law of Scattering, cited journal titles were tabulated
and ranked according to the number of times cited. Eleven databases were used to 
determine coverage of the most highly cited journal titles for all source
journals, as well as for a subset of practitioner-oriented journals.
Results: The most highly cited sources were journals, followed by government
documents, Internet resources, books, and miscellaneous resources. The databases 
with the most complete coverage of Zone 1 and 2 were Scopus, Web of Science Core 
Collection, and PubMed, while the worst performing databases were Health Business
Elite, ABI/Inform, and Business Source Complete.
Conclusions: The literature of health care management has expanded rapidly in the
last decade, with cumulative citations increasing by 76.6% and the number of
cited journal titles increasing by nearly 70% since the original study. Coverage 
of the core journals in popular databases remains high, although specialized
health care management and business databases did not perform as well as general 
or biomedical databases.

Objective: This study compares two maps of biomedical sciences using Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH) term co-assignments versus MeSH terms of citing/cited
articles and reveals similarities and differences between the two approaches.
Methods: MeSH terms assigned to 397,475 journal articles published in 2015, as
well as their 4,632,992 cited references, were retrieved from Web of Science and 
MEDLINE databases, respectively, which formed over 7 million MeSH co-assignments 
and nearly 18 million direct citation pairs. We generated six network
visualizations of biomedical science at three levels using Gephi software based
on these MeSH co-assignments and citation pairs.
Results: The MeSH co-assignment map contained more nodes and edges, as MeSH
co-assignments cover all medical topics discussed in articles. By contrast, the
MeSH citation map contained fewer but larger nodes and wider edges, as citation
links indicate connections to two similar medical topics.
Conclusion: These two types of maps emphasize different aspects of biomedical
sciences, with MeSH co-assignment maps focusing on the relationship between
topics in different categories and MeSH direct citation maps providing insights
into relationships between topics in the same or similar category.

Performance of gender detection tools: a comparative study of name-to-gender
inference services.

Sebo P(1).

Author information:

Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.

Objective: To evaluate the performance of gender detection tools that allow the
uploading of files (e.g., Excel or CSV files) containing first names, are usable 
by researchers without advanced computer skills, and are at least partially free 
of charge.
Methods: The study was conducted using four physician datasets (total number of
physicians: 6,131; 50.3% female) from Switzerland, a multilingual country. Four
gender detection tools met the inclusion criteria: three partially free (Gender
API, NamSor, and genderize.io) and one completely free (Wiki-Gendersort). For
each tool, we recorded the number of correct classifications (i.e., correct
gender assigned to a name), misclassifications (i.e., wrong gender assigned to a 
name), and nonclassifications (i.e., no gender assigned). We computed three
metrics: the proportion of misclassifications excluding nonclassifications
(errorCodedWithoutNA), the proportion of nonclassifications (naCoded), and the
proportion of misclassifications and nonclassifications (errorCoded).
Results: The proportion of misclassifications was low for all four gender
detection tools (errorCodedWithoutNA between 1.5 and 2.2%). By contrast, the
proportion of unrecognized names (naCoded) varied: 0% for NamSor, 0.3% for Gender
API, 4.5% for Wiki-Gendersort, and 16.4% for genderize.io. Using errorCoded,
which penalizes both types of error equally, we obtained the following results:
Gender API 1.8%, NamSor 2.0%, Wiki-Gendersort 6.6%, and genderize.io 17.7%.
Conclusions: Gender API and NamSor were the most accurate tools. Genderize.io led
to a high number of nonclassifications. Wiki-Gendersort may be a good compromise 
for researchers wishing to use a completely free tool. Other studies would be
useful to evaluate the performance of these tools in other populations (e.g.,
Asian).

Objective: A growing volume of studies address methods for performing systematic 
reviews of qualitative studies. One such methodological aspect is the conceptual 
framework used to structure the review question and plan the search strategy for 
locating relevant studies. The purpose of this case study was to evaluate the
retrieval potential of each element of conceptual frameworks in qualitative
systematic reviews in the health sciences.
Methods: The presence of elements from conceptual frameworks in publication
titles, abstracts, and controlled vocabulary in CINAHL and PubMed was analyzed
using a set of qualitative reviews and their included studies as a gold standard.
Using a sample of 101 publications, we determined whether particular publications
could be retrieved if a specific element from the conceptual framework was used
in the search strategy.
Results: We found that the relative recall of conceptual framework elements
varied considerably, with higher recall for patient/population (99%) and research
type (97%) and lower recall for intervention/phenomenon of interest (74%),
outcome (79%), and context (61%).
Conclusion: The use of patient/population and research type elements had high
relative recall for qualitative studies. However, other elements should be used
with great care due to lower relative recall.

Objective: The purpose of this scoping review is to evaluate the extent of
library or librarian involvement in informatics education in the health domain.
Methods: We searched eight databases from their inception to 2019 for reports of 
informatics educational activities for health professionals or health professions
students that involved library staff or resources. Two reviewers independently
screened all titles/abstracts (n=2,196) and resolved inclusion decisions by
consensus. From the full text of the 36 papers that met the inclusion criteria,
we extracted data on 41 educational activities.
Results: The most frequent coded purposes of activities were "teaching clinical
tools" (n=19, 46.3%) and "technology" (n=17; 41.5%). Medical students were the
most frequent primary audience (34.1%), though 41.5% of activities had multiple
audiences. Evaluation was reported for 24 activities (58.5%), only a few of which
assessed short or post-activity impact on attitudes, knowledge, or skills. The
most common long-term outcome was applying skills in other courses or clinical
experiences. Thematic analysis yielded three areas of outcomes and issues for the
library and organizational partners: expanded opportunities, technology and
resource issues, and value demonstration.
Conclusions: Limited published examples of health informatics educational
activities provide models for library roles in informatics education. More
librarians should report on their informatics educational activities and provide 
sufficient details on the interventions and their evaluation. This would
strengthen the evidence base about the potential impact of libraries within
informatics education.

BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision
loss worldwide. However, the mechanisms involved in the development and
progression of AMD are poorly delineated. We aimed to explore the critical genes 
involved in the progression of AMD.
METHODS: The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AMD retinal pigment
epithelial (RPE)/choroid tissues were identified using the microarray datasets
GSE99248 and GSE125564, which were downloaded from the gene expression omnibus
database. The overlapping DEGs from the two datasets were screened to identify
DEG-related biological pathways using gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. The hub genes were identified from these
DEGs through protein-protein interaction network analyses. The expression levels 
of hub genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
following the induction of senescence in ARPE-19 with FK866. Following the
identification of AMD-related key genes, the potential small molecule compounds
targeting the key genes were predicted by PharmacoDB. Finally, a microRNA-gene
interaction network was constructed.
RESULTS: Microarray analyses identified 174 DEGs in the AMD RPE compared to the
healthy RPE samples. These DEGs were primarily enriched in the pathways involved 
in the regulation of DNA replication, cell cycle, and proteasome-mediated protein
polyubiquitination. Among the top ten hub genes, HSP90AA1, CHEK1, PSMA4, PSMD4,
and PSMD8 were upregulated in the senescent ARPE-19 cells. Additionally, the
drugs targeting HSP90AA1, CHEK1, and PSMA4 were identified. We hypothesize that
Hsa-miR-16-5p might target four out of the five key DEGs in the AMD RPE.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, HSP90AA1 is likely to be a central gene
controlling the DNA replication and proteasome-mediated polyubiquitination during
the RPE senescence observed in the progression of AMD. Targeting HSP90AA1, CHEK1,
PSMA4, PSMD4, and/or PSMD8 genes through specific miRNAs or small molecules might
potentially alleviate the progression of AMD through attenuating RPE senescence.

BACKGROUND: The Danish Neuro Oncology Group (DNOG) has established national
consensus guidelines for the delineation of organs at risk (OAR) structures based
on published literature. This study was conducted to finalise these guidelines
and evaluate the inter-observer variability of the delineated OAR structures by
expert observers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The DNOG delineation guidelines were formed by participants
from all Danish centres that treat brain tumours with radiotherapy. In a two-day 
workshop, guidelines were discussed and finalised based on a pilot study.
Following this, the ten participants contoured the following OARs on T1-weighted 
gadolinium enhanced MRI from 13 patients with brain tumours: optic tracts, optic 
nerves, chiasm, spinal cord, brainstem, pituitary gland and hippocampus. The
metrics used for comparison were the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice), mean
surface distance (MSD) and others.
RESULTS: A total of 968 contours were delineated across the 13 patients. On
average eight (range six to nine) individual contour sets were made per patient. 
Good agreement was found across all structures with a median MSD below 1 mm for
most structures, with the chiasm performing the best with a median MSD of
0.45 mm. The Dice was as expected highly volume dependent, the brainstem (the
largest structure) had the highest Dice value with a median of 0.89 whereas
smaller volumes such as the chiasm had a Dice of 0.71.
CONCLUSION: Except for the caudal definition of the spinal cord, the variances
observed in the contours of OARs in the brain were generally low and consistent. 
Surface mapping revealed sub-regions of higher variance for some organs. The data
set is being prepared as a validation data set for auto-segmentation algorithms
for use within the Danish Comprehensive Cancer Centre - Radiotherapy and
potential collaborators.

Periprosthetic joint infection after total knee arthroplasty: a bibliometrics
analysis.

Shen S(1), Zhang Y(1), Zhang Q(1), Xiao K(1), Tang J(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical
University, Beijing, China.

BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has brought hope to patients with
malignant knee joint diseases. Infection is one of the serious complications
after TKA, and the purpose of this study was to use bibliometrics to analyze the 
current research status of infection after this surgery, to unmask any
deficiencies with current research, and to provide references for future
researchers.
METHODS: We used the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E) database in the Web 
of Science Core Collection (WOSCC) as the data source, using the search terms
"total knee arthroplasty" and "infection" respectively. The "And" operation was
performed on the search results of the two subject terms, and the intersection of
the two search results was taken as the final search result. CiteSpace software
was used to analyze the results.
RESULTS: The search results consisted of 5,600 documents, with a total citation
frequency of 148,871. The average number of citations for each literature was
26.58, and the h-index was 142. The top five countries in the number of
publications were the United States, China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and
Spain, while the top five centrally ranked countries were the United States, the 
Netherlands, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France. The top five institutions
with the number of publications were Thomas Jefferson Univ, Mayo Clin, Hosp
Special Surg, Rush Univ, and Cleveland Clin, while the top institutions for
centrality were Thomas Jefferson Univ, Tel Aviv Univ, Univ Melbourne, and Rush
Univ. The top five authors of the number of published articles were Parvizi J,
Mont MA, Valle CJD, Chen AF, and Hanssen AD, and the top three authors for
centrality were Parvizi J, Mont MA, and Valle CJD. The main journals were J Bone 
Joint Surg Am, Clin Orthop Relat R, J Arthroplasty, J Bone Joint Surg Br, and Int
Orthop, and the top five keywords used were total knee arthroplasty, total hip
arthroplasty, replacement, infection, and arthroplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of studies with high-level evidence. The focus of
related research in recent years has not changed significantly. More randomized
controlled studies are required to provide evidence-based medicine.

China.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel, cisplatin, and
fluorouracil (TPF) regimen followed by intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on
locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
METHODS: A total of 150 patients with locally advanced NPC [American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2009 stage IIIa-IVb] received 2 or 3 cycles of a TPF
regimen as induction chemotherapy. A group of 67 participants (TPF group)
continued to receive TPF chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the remaining 83
participants (P group) received cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
RESULTS: A median follow-up of 35 months (4-66 months) showed that there was no
significant difference between P group and TPF group in progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). The incidence rate of myelosuppression at 3-4
degrees was 16.9% and 34.3% in the P group and TPF group (P=0.029), respectively,
and the oral mucosa reaction at 3-4 degrees was 18.1% and 37.3% in the P group
and TPF group, respectively (P=0.007). The 3-4-degree skin reaction in the P
group and TPF group was 15.7% and 29.9% (P=0.030), respectively. The rate of
liver function injury in the P group was significantly lower than that in TPF
group (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy,
the concurrent TPF regimen and IMRT showed no significant improvement in OS and
PFS in patients with advanced NPC, but exhibited more severe hematologic
toxicity, oral mucosal responses, skin reactions, and liver functional
impairment.

BACKGROUND: Systemic therapeutic hypothermia is commonly used in patients with
craniocerebral injury, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and high fever, but its
effect is still controversial that some reported hypothermia is helpful for
thrombosis while someothers thought it had limited effects on thrombosis. In
order to explore the effect of intraoperative hypothermia on patients, we
analyzed the role of hypothermia in promoting thrombosis, in order to guide the
implementation of corresponding countermeasures and timely intervention.
METHODS: The databases of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CKNI) were used to retrieve relevant studies. The
selected literatures were evaluated with Review Manager 5.2. Forest plots,
sensitivity analysis, and bias analysis were used to analyze the included
studies.
RESULTS: A total of 2,053 patients in 8 trials (762 patients were randomly
divided into hypothermia group and 1,191 patients in normothermia group) were
included in the meta-analysis. High quality randomized evidence suggested that
therapeutic hypothermia is associated with thrombosis and high mortality in
critically ill patients. Although therapeutic hypothermia may still be beneficial
in specific environments, it is best to avoid the routine application of
therapeutic hypothermia outside the circumstances specified in the international 
guidelines (adult cardiac arrest and neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy).
DISCUSSION: This study shows that intraoperative hypothermia is more likely to
cause thrombosis, massive hemorrhage, and even death in comparison to routine
nursing.

[Delayed cerebrospinal fluid leak post-intensity-modulated radiotherapy for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a case report].

[Article in Chinese]

Gao W, Wu J, Shi J, Lai Y.

A 60-year-old man, who diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma staged as T1N1M0 in
2003 and received 68 Gy 30 times intensity modulated radiotherapy for primary
tumor, was diagnosed as "cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea（left side）; purulent
meningitis; nasopharyngeal carcinoma（post-radiotherapy） " in 2017. The patient
received an emergency repair of the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by nasal
endoscope approach surgery. No rhinorrhea complained in the following 2 years.
But two years later, the patient complained a recurrent rhinorrhea by no
incentives. The CT scan found ethmoid-like defect change in bottom of the right
sphenoid sinus bone this time and no tumor recurrence was observed in CT scan or 
MRI exam. Then the patient received a second time right-side endoscopic
transphenoid approach cerebrospinal fluid leakage repair operation. The patient
recovered well after operation and regular endoscope follow-up showed no evidence
of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. This case showed that the risk of
cerebrospinal fluid leakage should be considered by the use of intensity
modulated radiotherapy. For the cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea caused by
osteonecrosis after radiotherapy, emergency surgical treatment is required since 
conservative treatment may not be effective.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of using the bidirectional local distance
based medical similarity index (MSI) to evaluate automatic segmentation on
medical images.
METHODS: Taking the intermediate risk clinical target volume for nasopharyngeal
carcinoma manually segmented by an experience radiation oncologist as region of
interest, using Atlas-based and deep-learning-based methods to obtain automatic
segmentation respectively, and calculated multiple MSI and Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) between manual segmentation and automatic segmentation. Then
the difference between MSI and DSC was comparatively analyzed.
RESULTS: DSC values for Atlas-based and deep-learning-based automatic
segmentation were 0.73 and 0.84 respectively. MSI values for them varied between 
0.29~0.78 and 0.44~0.91 under different inside-outside-level.
CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to use MSI to evaluate the results of automatic
segmentation. By setting the penalty coefficient, it can reflect phenomena such
as under-delineation and over-delineation, and improve the sensitivity of medical
image contour similarity evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the rules of acupoint and medication selection of acupoint 
application therapy for functional constipation (FC) by data mining technology.
METHODS: The clinical research literature regarding acupoint application therapy 
for FC from published to February 26, 2020 was searched in CNKI, VIP, Wanfang,
SinoMed and PubMed. The prescriptions were extracted, and by using SPSS24.0 and
SPSS Modeler14.0 software, the use of high-frequency acupoints and medication was
summarized. The association rule analysis, cluster analysis and core prescription
analysis of acupoints and medication were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 122 prescriptions of acupoint application therapy were
included, involving 32 acupoints. The core prescription of acupoints was Tianshu 
(ST 25), Dachangshu (BL 25), Shenque (CV 8) and Guanyuan (CV 4). The
high-frequency meridians mainly included conception vessel, yangming stomach
meridian of foot and taiyang bladder meridian of foot. The core prescription of
medication was rheum officinale, mirabilite, immature bitter orange, mangnolia
officinalis, common aucklandia root and borneol.
CONCLUSION: The use of local acupoint and regulating-qi and purgating medication 
is an important principle of acupoint application therapy for FC.

PURPOSE: The RefleXion™ X1 is a novel radiotherapy system that is designed for
image-guided radiotherapy, and eventually, biology-guided radiotherapy (BgRT).
BgRT is a treatment paradigm that tracks tumor motion using real-time positron
emission signals. This study reports the small-field measurement results and the 
validation of a Monte Carlo (MC) model of the first clinical RefleXion unit.
METHODS: The RefleXion linear accelerator (linac) produces a 6 MV flattening
filter free (FFF) photon beam and consists of a binary multileaf collimator (MLC)
system with 64 leaves and two pairs of y-jaws. The maximum clinical field size
achievable is 400 × 20 mm2 . The y-jaws provide either a 10 or 20 mm opening at
source-to-axis distance (SAD) of 850 mm. The width of each MLC leaf at SAD is
6.25 mm. Percentage depth doses (PDDs) and relative beam profiles were acquired
using an Edge diode detector in a water tank for field sizes from 12.5 × 10 to
100 × 20 mm2 . Beam profiles were also measured using films. Output factors of
fields ranging from 6.25 × 10 to 100 × 20 mm2 were measured using W2 scintillator
detector, Edge detector, and films. Output correction factors k of the Edge
detector for RefleXion were calculated. An MC model of the linac including
pre-MLC beam sources and detailed structures of MLC and lower y-jaws was
validated against the measurements. Simulation codes BEAMnrc and GATE were
utilized.
RESULTS: The diode measured PDD at 10 cm depth (PDD10) increases from 53.6% to
56.9% as the field opens from 12.5 × 10 to 100 × 20 mm2 . The W2-measured output 
factor increases from 0.706 to 1 as the field opens from 6.25 × 10 to 100 × 20
mm2 (reference field size). The output factors acquired by diode and film differ 
from the W2 results by 1.65% (std = 1.49%) and 2.09% (std = 1.41%) on average,
respectively. The profile penumbra and full-width half-maximum (FWHM) measured by
diode agree well with the film results with a deviation of 0.60 mm and 0.73% on
average, respectively. The averaged beam profile consistency calculated between
the diode- and film-measured profiles among different depths is within 1.72%. By 
taking the W2 measurements as the ground truth, the output correction factors k
for Edge detector ranging from 0.958 to 1 were reported. For the MC model
validation, the simulated PDD10 agreed within 0.6% to the diode measurement. The 
MC-simulated output factor differed from the W2 results by 2.3% on average
(std = 3.7%), while the MC simulated beam penumbra differed from the diode
results by 0.67 mm on average (std = 0.42 mm). The MC FWHM agreed with the diode 
results to within 1.40% on average. The averaged beam profile consistency
calculated between the diode and MC profiles among different depths is less than 
1.29%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the first small-field dosimetry of a clinical 
RefleXion system. A complete and accurate MC model of the RefleXion linac has
been validated.

PURPOSE: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is sensitive to anatomical density
variations. We examined the dosimetric effect of variable intestinal filling
condition during CIRT to ten sacral chordoma patients.
METHODS: For each patient, eight virtual computed tomography scans (vCTs) were
generated by varying the density distribution within the rectum and the sigmoid
in the planning computed tomography (pCT) with a density override approach
mimicking a heterogeneous combination of gas and feces. Totally full and empty
intestinal preparations were modelled. In addition, five different intestinal
filling conditions were modelled by a mixed density pattern derived from two
combined and weighted Gaussian distributions simulating gas and feces
respectively. Finally, a patient-specific mixing proportion was estimated by
evaluating the daily amount of gas detected in the cone beam computed tomography 
(CBCT). Dose distribution was recalculated on each vCT and dose volume histograms
(DVHs) were examined.
RESULTS: No target coverage degradation was observed at different vCTs. Rectum
and sigma dose degradation ranged respectively between: [-6.7; 21.6]GyE and
[-0.7; 15.4]GyE for D50%; [-377.4; 1197.9] and [-95.2; 1027.5] for AUC; [-1.2;
10.7]GyE and [-2.6; 21.5]GyE for D1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Variation of intestinal density can greatly influence the
penetration depth of charged particle and might compromise dose distribution. In 
particular cases, with large clinical target volume in very close proximity to
rectum and sigmoid colon, it is appropriate to evaluate the amount of gas present
in the daily CBCT images even if it is totally included in the reference planning
structures.

Data fusion has gained much attention in the field of life sciences, and this is 
because analysis of biological samples may require the use of data coming from
multiple complementary sources to express the samples fully. Data fusion lies in 
the idea that different data platforms detect different biological entities.
Therefore, if these different biological compounds are then combined, they can
provide comprehensive profiling and understanding of the research question in
hand. Data fusion can be performed in three different traditional ways:
low-level, mid-level, and high-level data fusion. However, the increasing
complexity and amount of generated data require the development of more
sophisticated fusion approaches. In that regard, the current study presents an
advanced data fusion approach (i.e. proximities stacking) based on random forest 
proximities coupled with the pseudo-sample principle. Four different data
platforms of 130 samples each (faecal microbiome, blood, blood headspace, and
exhaled breath samples of patients who have Crohn's disease) were used to
demonstrate the classification performance of this new approach. More
specifically, 104 samples were used to train and validate the models, whereas the
remaining 26 samples were used to validate the models externally. Mid-level,
high-level, as well as individual platform classification predictions, were made 
and compared against the proximities stacking approach. The performance of each
approach was assessed by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of each
model for the external test set, and visualized by performing principal component
analysis on the proximity matrices of the training samples to then, subsequently,
project the test samples onto that space. The implementation of pseudo-samples
allowed for the identification of the most important variables per platform,
finding relations among variables of the different data platforms, and the
examination of how variables behave in the samples. The proximities stacking
approach outperforms both mid-level and high-level fusion approaches, as well as 
all individual platform predictions. Concurrently, it tackles significant
bottlenecks of the traditional ways of fusion and of another advanced fusion way 
discussed in the paper, and finally, it contradicts the general belief that the
more data, the merrier the result, and therefore, considerations have to be taken
into account before any data fusion analysis is conducted.

BACKGROUND: An estimand is a precise description of the treatment effect to be
estimated from a trial (the question) and is distinct from the methods of
statistical analysis (how the question is to be answered). The potential use of
estimands to improve trial research and reporting has been underpinned by the
recent publication of the ICH E9(R1) Addendum on the use of estimands in clinical
trials in 2019. We set out to assess how well estimands are described in
published trial protocols.
METHODS: We reviewed 50 trial protocols published in October 2020 in Trials and
BMJ Open. For each protocol, we determined whether the estimand for the primary
outcome was explicitly stated, not stated but inferable (i.e. could be
constructed from the information given), or not inferable.
RESULTS: None of the 50 trials explicitly described the estimand for the primary 
outcome, and in 74% of trials, it was impossible to infer the estimand from the
information included in the protocol. The population attribute of the estimand
could not be inferred in 36% of trials, the treatment condition attribute in 20%,
the population-level summary measure in 34%, and the handling of intercurrent
events in 60% (the strategy for handling non-adherence was not inferable in 32%
of protocols, and the strategy for handling mortality was not inferable in 80% of
the protocols for which it was applicable). Conversely, the outcome attribute was
stated for all trials. In 28% of trials, three or more of the five estimand
attributes could not be inferred.
CONCLUSIONS: The description of estimands in published trial protocols is poor,
and in most trials, it is impossible to understand exactly what treatment effect 
is being estimated. Given the utility of estimands to improve clinical research
and reporting, this urgently needs to change.

BACKGROUND: To study the impact of valvular heart disease (VHD) on hip
replacement, particularly the clinical impactions of aortic stenosis before
total/partial hip arthroplasty.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Data on patients who had
undergone hip replacement from 2005 to 2014 were extracted from the NIS database.
Independent t test and chi-square test were used to analyze the essential
characteristics of patients. Multivariate regression was used to estimate the
correlation among demographics, comorbidities, complications, hospitalization
costs, and time.
RESULTS: VHD accounted for 5.56% and AS accounted for 0.03% of the patients
before hip replacement surgeries. Patients with VHD before hip replacement are
related to the following characteristics: female patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.15
[1.12-1.18]), elective admission (OR = 0.78 [0.76-0.80]), Charlson Comorbidity
Index ≥3 (OR = 1.06 [1.03-1.08]), large-volume hospitals (OR = 1.13 [1.1-1.2]),
teaching hospitals (OR = 5 4.4 [2.9-6.7]), and hospital location in urban areas
(OR = 1.22 [1.2-1.3]). In addition, VHD is a risk factor for mortality and some
acute postoperative medical complications, such as acute cardiac event (OR = 2.96
[2.87-3.04]), acute pulmonary edema (OR = 1.13 [1.06-1.21]), acute
cerebrovascular event (OR = 1.22 [1.16-1.74]), and acute renal failure (OR = 1.22
[1.17-1.27]). It also has an impact on DVT/PE (OR = 0.89 [0.8-0.99]). Patients
with AS before hip replacement have basic demographic characteristics like those 
of hip replacement patients with valvular disease. Patients with AS are older
than those without AS before surgery (OR = 3.28 [2.27-4.75) and are related to
the following characteristics: female patients (OR = 1.92 [1.32-2.8]) and
elective admission (OR = 0.51 [0.36-0.75]). The perioperative period is limited
to acute postoperative complications, such as acute cardiac events (OR = 2.50
[1.76-3.53]) and acute hepatic failure (OR = 7.69 [1.8-32.89]). Both valvular
diseases and AS are associated with a higher mortality rate and hospitalization
cost.
CONCLUSION: VHD independently predicted mortality rate and surgical and medical
complications after total/partial hip arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: Functional genome annotation is the process of labelling functional
genomic regions with descriptive information. Manual curation can produce higher 
quality genome annotations than fully automated methods. Manual annotation
efforts are time-consuming and complex; however, software can help reduce these
drawbacks.
RESULTS: We created Manual Annotation Studio (MAS) to improve the efficiency of
the process of manual functional annotation prokaryotic and viral genomes. MAS
allows users to upload unannotated genomes, provides an interface to edit and
upload annotations, tracks annotation history and progress, and saves data to a
relational database. MAS provides users with pertinent information through a
simple point and click interface to execute and visualize results for multiple
homology search tools (blastp, rpsblast, and HHsearch) against multiple databases
(Swiss-Prot, nr, CDD, PDB, and an internally generated database). MAS was
designed to accept connections over the local area network (LAN) of a lab or
organization so multiple users can access it simultaneously. MAS can take
advantage of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters by interfacing with SGE or
SLURM and data can be exported from MAS in a variety of formats (FASTA, GenBank, 
GFF, and excel).
CONCLUSIONS: MAS streamlines and provides structure to manual functional
annotation projects. MAS enhances the ability of users to generate, interpret,
and compare results from multiple tools. The structure that MAS provides can
improve project organization and reduce annotation errors. MAS is ideal for
team-based annotation projects because it facilitates collaboration.

BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for
progression to an end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or kidney
transplantation. We investigated the association of lifestyle behaviors with the 
initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) among CKD patients using an
employment-based health insurance claims database linked with specific health
checkup (SHC) data.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 149,620 CKD patients aged 40-74
years who underwent a SHC between April 2008 and March 2016. CKD patients were
identified using ICD-10 diagnostic codes and SHC results. We investigated
lifestyle behaviors recorded at SHC. Initiation of RRT was defined by medical
procedure claims. Lifestyle behaviors related to the initiation of RRT were
identified using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with
recency-weighted cumulative exposure as a time-dependent covariate.
RESULTS: During 384,042 patient-years of follow-up by the end of March 2016, 295 
dialysis and no kidney transplantation cases were identified. Current smoking
(hazard ratio: 1.87, 95% confidence interval, 1.04─3.36), skipping breakfast
(4.80, 1.98─11.62), and taking sufficient rest along with sleep (2.09, 1.14─3.85)
were associated with the initiation of RRT.
CONCLUSIONS: Among CKD patients, the lifestyle behaviors of smoking, skipping
breakfast, and sufficient rest along with sleep were independently associated
with the initiation of RRT. Our study strengthens the importance of monitoring
lifestyle behaviors to delay the progression of mild CKD to RRT in the Japanese
working generation. A substantial portion of subjects had missing data for eGFR
and drinking frequency, warranting verification of these results in prospective
studies.

PURPOSE: The present work aims to guide the physicist in order to start automated
planning for the VMAT treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by giving a
recipe that was set up and tested during a long-term (two years) evaluation.
METHODS: An automatic technique in AutoPlanning module of the Pinnacle3 (Philips 
Medical Systems, Fitchburg, WI) treatment planning system was created and
validated by comparing dose distributions of automatic plans (APs) and manual
plans (MPs) and by performing a blind AP-MP comparison on a cohort of 20
patients. Automatic technique was then applied to 145 patients and failures were 
recorded i.e. the number of times for which dose distributions produced by the
automatic module were not suitable for treatment.
RESULTS: Each of the 20 APs considered in the validation step was clinically
acceptable and proved to be better (15 cases) or equal (5 cases) respect to MPs. 
A statistically significant improvement in brain stem, optic pathways, cochleae, 
pituitary gland and scalp sparing was observed for APs, while no statistically
significant differences were recorded in target coverage or plan parameters. For 
only 5 cases out of the 145 plans the operator intervention was needed in order
to obtain a clinical acceptable plan, while for the remaining 140 plans the
automatic created solution was suitable.
CONCLUSIONS: A straightforward automatic procedure has been created and tested in
our clinic. The AutoPlanning technique proposed represents a reliable tool to
improve treatment planning efficiency and the recipe, here presented, could be
simply imported to every radiotherapy center.

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in
datasets. Automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised
machine learning models, which require a labelled dataset for their calibration, 
or unsupervised models, which do not require labels. While academic research has 
produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly 
detection, the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a 
comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive, objective, and
systematic. This knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study,
where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are
evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural
aquatic systems. To this end, anomaly detection performance, labelling efforts,
as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account. As a 
result, our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the
different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular
paradigm in machine learning. Most importantly, our results show that
expert-based data annotation is extremely valuable for anomaly detection based on
machine learning.

The use of approved nomenclature in publications is vital to enable effective
scientific communication and is particularly crucial when discussing genes of
clinical relevance. Here, we discuss several examples of cases where the failure 
of researchers to use a HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)-approved symbol
in publications has led to confusion between unrelated human genes in the
literature. We also inform authors of the steps they can take to ensure that they
use approved nomenclature in their manuscripts and discuss how referencing HGNC
IDs can remove ambiguity when referring to genes that have previously been
published with confusing alias symbols.

Automatic medical image segmentation plays a critical role in scientific research
and medical care. Existing high-performance deep learning methods typically rely 
on large training datasets with high-quality manual annotations, which are
difficult to obtain in many clinical applications. Here, we introduce
Annotation-effIcient Deep lEarning (AIDE), an open-source framework to handle
imperfect training datasets. Methodological analyses and empirical evaluations
are conducted, and we demonstrate that AIDE surpasses conventional
fully-supervised models by presenting better performance on open datasets
possessing scarce or noisy annotations. We further test AIDE in a real-life case 
study for breast tumor segmentation. Three datasets containing 11,852 breast
images from three medical centers are employed, and AIDE, utilizing 10% training 
annotations, consistently produces segmentation maps comparable to those
generated by fully-supervised counterparts or provided by independent
radiologists. The 10-fold enhanced efficiency in utilizing expert labels has the 
potential to promote a wide range of biomedical applications.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the relationship between initial school
closures and children's health by comparing health and well-being outcomes
collected during school closures (April-June 2020) via HAPPEN (the Health and
Attainment of Pupils in a Primary Education Network) with data from the same
period in 2019 and 2018 via the HAPPEN Survey.
SETTING: The study was conducted online with 161 primary schools across Wales
involved in the 'HAPPEN At Home' Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected via the 'HAPPEN At Home' Survey capturing the
typical health behaviours of children aged 8-11 years from 1333 participants
across Wales. These data were compared with data in 2018 and 2019 also collected 
between April and June, from HAPPEN (2019 (n=1150) and 2018 (n=475)).
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included validated
measures of physical activity, screen time, diet and dental health, as well as
well-being, competency and autonomy. Free school meal (FSM) status was used as a 
proxy for socioeconomic deprivation. Analyses were repeated stratifying by FSM.
RESULTS: Comparing responses between April-June in 2020 (n=1068), 2019 (n=1150)
and 2018 (n=475), there were improvements in physical activity levels, sleep
time, happiness and general well-being for children during school closures
compared with previous years. However, children on FSM ate fewer fruits and
vegetables (21% less at five or more portions of fruits and vegetables (95% CI:
5.7% to 37%)) and had lower self-assessed school competence compared with 2019.
Compared with those not on FSM, they also spent less time doing physical activity
(13.03%, 95% CI: 3.3% to 21.7%) and consumed more takeaways (16.3%, 95% CI: 2% to
30%) during school closures.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that schools are important in reducing
inequalities in physical health. The physical health (eg, physical activity and
diet) of children eligible for FSM may be affected by prolonged school closures.

Database-driven suspect screening has proven to be a useful tool to detect new
psychoactive substances (NPS) outside the scope of targeted screening; however,
the lack of retention times specific to a liquid chromatography (LC) system can
result in a large number of false positives. A singular stream-lined,
quantitative structure-retention relationship (QSRR)-based retention time
prediction model integrating multiple LC systems with different elution
conditions is presented using retention time data (n = 1281) from the online
crowd-sourced database, HighResNPS. Modelling was performed using an artificial
neural network (ANN), specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), using four
molecular descriptors and one-hot encoding of categorical labels. Evaluation of
test set predictions (n = 193) yielded coefficient of determination (R2) and mean
absolute error (MAE) values of 0.942 and 0.583 min, respectively. The model
successfully differentiated between LC systems, predicting 54%, 81% and 97% of
the test set within ±0.5, ±1 and ±2 min, respectively. Additionally, retention
times for an analyte not previously observed by the model were predicted within
±1 min for each LC system. The developed model can be used to predict retention
times for all analytes on HighResNPS for each participating laboratory's LC
system to further support suspect screening.

BACKGROUND: Medical experts in the domain of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) acquire
specific knowledge from diabetic patients through monitoring and interaction.
This allows them to know the disease and information about other conditions or
comorbidities, treatments, and typical consequences of the Mexican population.
This indicates that an expert in a domain knows technical information about the
domain and contextual factors that interact with it in the real world,
contributing to new knowledge generation. For capturing and managing information 
about the DM, it is necessary to design and implement techniques and methods that
allow: determining the most relevant conceptual dimensions and their correct
organization, the integration of existing medical and clinical information from
different resources, and the generation of structures that represent the
deduction process of the doctor. An Ontology Network is a collection of
ontologies of diverse knowledge domains which can be interconnected by
meta-relations. This article describes an Ontology Network for representing DM in
Mexico, designed by a proposed methodology. The information used for Ontology
Network building include the ontological resource reuse and non-ontological
resource transformation for ontology design and ontology extending by natural
language processing techniques. These are medical information extracted from
vocabularies, taxonomies, medical dictionaries, ontologies, among others.
Additionally, a set of semantic rules has been defined within the Ontology
Network to derive new knowledge.
RESULTS: An Ontology Network for DM in Mexico has been built from six
well-defined domains, resulting in new classes, using ontological and
non-ontological resources to offer a semantic structure for assisting in the
medical diagnosis process. The network comprises 1367 classes, 20 object
properties, 63 data properties, and 4268 individuals from seven different
ontologies. Ontology Network evaluation was carried out by verifying the purpose 
for its design and some quality criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: The composition of the Ontology Network offers a set of well-defined
ontological modules facilitating the reuse of one or more of them. The inclusion 
of international vocabularies as SNOMED CT or ICD-10 reinforces the
representation by international standards. It increases the semantic
interoperability of the network, providing the opportunity to integrate other
ontologies with the same vocabularies. The ontology network design methodology
offers a guide for ontology developers about how to use ontological and
non-ontological resources in order to exploit the maximum of information and
knowledge from a set of domains that share or not information.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy. Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection correlates with MM features. This study aimed
to identify MM prognostic biomarkers with potential association with COVID-19.
METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in five MM data sets (GSE47552,
GSE16558, GSE13591, GSE6477, and GSE39754) with the same expression trends were
screened out. Functional enrichment analysis and the protein-protein interaction 
network were performed for all DEGs. Prognosis-associated DEGs were screened
using the stepwise Cox regression analysis in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA)
MMRF-CoMMpass cohort and the GSE24080 data set. Prognosis-associated DEGs
associated with COVID-19 infection in the GSE164805 data set were also
identified.
RESULTS: A total of 98 DEGs with the same expression trends in five data sets
were identified, and 83 DEGs were included in the protein-protein interaction
network. Cox regression analysis identified 16 DEGs were associated with MM
prognosis in the TCGA cohort, and only the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 6C
(COX6C) gene (HR = 1.717, 95% CI 1.231-2.428, p = .002) and the
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene (HR = 0.882,
95% CI 0.798-0.975, p = .014) were independent factors related to MM prognosis in
the GSE24080 data set. Both of them were downregulated in patients with mild
COVID-19 infection compared with controls but were upregulated in patients with
severe COVID-19 compared with patients with mild illness.
CONCLUSIONS: The NOD2 and COX6C genes might be used as prognostic biomarkers in
MM. The two genes might be associated with the development of COVID-19 infection.

BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive lung diseases may be at risk of
hospitalization and/or death due to COVID-19.
AIM: To estimate the frequency of severe COVID-19, and COVID-19-related mortality
in a well-defined large population of patients with asthma and chronic
inflammatory lung disease (COPD). Further to assess the frequency of asthma and
COPD as registered comorbidities at discharge from hospital, and in death
certificates.
METHODS: At the start of the pandemic, the Swedish National Airway Register
(SNAR) included 271,404 patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma and/or
COPD. In September 2020, after the first COVID-19 wave in Sweden, the database
was linked with the National Patient Register (NPR), the Swedish Intensive Care
Register and the Swedish Cause of Death Register, which all provide data about
COVID-19 based on International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes. Severe
COVID-19 was defined as hospitalization and/or intensive care or death due to
COVID-19.
RESULTS: Among patients in SNAR, 0.5% with asthma, and 1.2% with COPD were
identified with severe COVID-19. Among patients  < 18 years with asthma, only
0.02% were severely infected. Of hospitalized adults, 14% with asthma and 29%
with COPD died. Further, of patients in SNAR, 56% with asthma and 81% with COPD
were also registered in the NPR, while on death certificates the agreement was
lower (asthma 24% and COPD 71%).
CONCLUSION: The frequency of severe COVID-19 in asthma and COPD was relative low.
Mortality for those hospitalized was double as high in COPD compared to asthma.
Comorbid asthma and COPD were not always identified among patients with severe
COVID-19.

Avenue, Zhengzhou, China.

ABSTRACT: Since lung nodules on computed tomography images can have different
shapes, contours, textures or locations and may be attached to neighboring blood 
vessels or pleural surfaces, accurate segmentation is still challenging. In this 
study, we propose an accurate segmentation method based on an improved U-Net
convolutional network for different types of lung nodules on computed tomography 
images.The first phase is to segment lung parenchyma and correct the lung contour
by applying α-hull algorithm. The second phase is to extract image pairs of
patches containing lung nodules in the center and the corresponding ground truth 
and build an improved U-Net network with introduction of batch normalization.A
large number of experiments manifest that segmentation performance of Dice loss
has superior results than mean square error and Binary_crossentropy loss. The
α-hull algorithm and batch normalization can improve the segmentation performance
effectively. Our best result for Dice similar coefficient (0.8623) is also more
competitive than other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms.In order to
segment different types of lung nodules accurately, we propose an improved U-Net 
network, which can improve the segmentation accuracy effectively. Moreover, this 
work also has practical value in helping radiologists segment lung nodules and
diagnose lung cancer.

ABSTRACT: Vascular access (VA) failure is an important problem for patients
undergoing hemodialysis, and maintaining VA patency is challenging. In this
study, we used a nationwide database to investigate the effects of nitrate, as a 
vasodilator, on VA failure in hemodialysis patients.We investigated the Korean
insurance claims data of hemodialysis patients who underwent angioplasty for VA
failure between January 2012 and December 2017. The patients were divided into 2 
groups: those not receiving vasodilator therapy (controls) and those receiving
any vasodilator administration (vasodilator treatment, VDT). The primary endpoint
was VA primary patency, defined as the time between arteriovenous dialysis access
creation and the first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA).During the
study period, a total of 6350 patients were recruited, 409 (6.4%) patients
assigned to the VDT group and 5941 (93.6%) controls. PTA was performed in 998
patients (15.7%), including 8 in the VDT group and 990 controls. The VA site PTA 
rate was significantly lower in the VDT group (2.0%) than in the control group
(16.7%, P < .001). In the subgroup analysis, the patency rates associated with
the different vasodilators were similar (P = .736). All vasodilators, except
molsidomine, improved the patency rate by approximately 20%.In this large
national database study, vasodilator administration was associated with higher VA
primary patency, compared with controls, in hemodialysis patients. VDT may have a
beneficial effect on maintaining VA patency in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

ABSTRACT: Various researches demonstrated that transcription factors (TFs) played
a crucial role in the progression and prognosis of cancer. However, few studies
indicated that TFs were independent biomarkers for the prognosis of thyroid
papillary carcinoma (TPC). Our aim was to establish and validate a novel TF
signature for the prediction of TPC patients' recurrence-free survival (RFS) from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to improve the prediction of survival in 
TPC patients.The genes expression data and corresponding clinical information for
TPC were obtained from TCGA database. In total, 722 TFs and 545 TPC patients with
eligible clinical information were determined to build a novel TF signature. All 
TFs were included in a univariate Cox regression model. Then, the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model was employed to identify
candidate TFs relevant to TPC patients' RFS. Finally, multivariate Cox regression
was conducted via the candidate TFs for the selection of the TF signatures in the
RFS assessment of TPC patients.We identified 6 TFs that were related to TPC
patients' RFS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed in
training, validation, and whole datasets, we verified the high capacity of the
6-TF panel for predicting TPC patients' RFS (AUC at 1, 3, and 5 years were 0.880,
0.934, and 0.868, respectively, in training dataset; 0.760, 0.737, and 0.726,
respectively, in validation dataset; and 0.777, 0.776, and 0.761, respectively,
in entire dataset). The result of Kaplan-Meier analysis suggested that the TPC
patients with low scores had longer RFS than the TPC patients with high score
(P = .003). A similar outcome was displayed in the validation dataset (P = .001) 
and the entire dataset (P = 2e-05). In addition, a nomogram was conducted through
risk score, cancer status, C-index, receiver operating characteristic, and the
calibration plots analysis implied good value and clinical utility of the
nomogram.We constructed and validated a novel 6-TF signature-based nomogram for
predicting the RFS of TPC patients.

Objective: To explore the clinical feasibility of applying deep learning (DL)
reconstruction algorithm in low-dose thin-slice liver CT examination of healthy
volunteers by comparing the reconstruction algorithm based on DL, filtered back
projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm and iterative reconstruction (IR)
algorithm.
Methods: A standard water phantom with a diameter of 180 mm was scanned, using
the 160 slice multi-detector CT scanning of United Imaging Healthcare, to compare
the noise power spectrums of DL, FBP and IR algorithms. 100 healthy volunteers
were prospectively enrolled, with 50 assigned to the normal dose group (ND) and
50 to the low dose group (LD). IR algorithm was used in the ND group to
reconstruct images, while DL, FBP and IR algorithms were used in the LD group to 
reconstruct images. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the liver CT
values, the liver noise, liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast noise ratio 
(CNR) and figure of merit (FOM) of the images of ND-IR, LD-FBP, LD-IR and LD-DL. 
The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyse subjective scores of anatomical
structures.
Results: The DL algorithm had the lowest average peak value of noise power
spectrum, and its shape was similar to that of medium-level IR algorithm. Liver
CT values of ND-IR, LD-FBP, LD-IR and LD-DL did not show statistically
significant difference. The noise of LD-DL was lower than that of LD-FBP, LD-IR
and ND-IR ( P<0.05), and the SNR, CNR and FOM of LD-DL were higher than those of 
LD-FBP, LD-IR and ND-IR ( P<0.05). The subjective scores of anatomical structures
of LD-DL did not show significant difference compared to those of ND-IR ( P
>0.05), and were higher than those of LD-FBP and LD-IR. The radiation dose of the
LD group was reduced by about 50.2% compared with that of the ND group.
Conclusion: The DL algorithm with noise shape similar to the medium iterative
grade IR commonly used in clinical practice showed higher noise reduction ability
than IR did. Compared with FBP, the DL algorithm had smoother noise shape, but
much better noise reduction ability. The application of DL algorithm in low-dose 
thin-slice liver CT of healthy volunteers can help achieve the standard image
quality of liver CT.

Medical image quality is highly relative to clinical diagnosis and treatment,
leading to a popular research topic of medical image denoising. Image denoising
based on deep learning methods has attracted considerable attention owing to its 
excellent ability of automatic feature extraction. Most existing methods for
medical image denoising adapted to certain types of noise have difficulties in
handling spatially varying noise; meanwhile, image detail losses and structure
changes occurred in the denoised image. Considering image context perception and 
structure preserving, this paper firstly introduces a medical image denoising
method based on conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for various
unknown noises. In the proposed architecture, noise image with the corresponding 
gradient image is merged as network conditional information, which enhances the
contrast between the original signal and noise according to the structural
specificity. A novel generator with residual dense blocks makes full use of the
relationship among convolutional layers to explore image context. Furthermore,
the reconstruction loss and WGAN loss are combined as the objective loss function
to ensure the consistency of denoised image and real image. A series of
experiments for medical image denoising are conducted with the denoising results 
of PSNR = 33.2642 and SSIM = 0.9206 on JSRT datasets and PSNR = 35.1086 and SSIM 
= 0.9328 on LIDC datasets. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the
superior performance of the proposed method is outstanding.

The cohesin complex plays critical roles in genomic stability and gene expression
through effects on 3D architecture. Cohesin core subunit genes are mutated across
a wide cross-section of cancers, but not in germinal center (GC) derived
lymphomas. In spite of this, haploinsufficiency of cohesin ATPase subunit Smc3
was shown to contribute to malignant transformation of GC B-cells in mice. Herein
we explored potential mechanisms and clinical relevance of Smc3 deficiency in GC 
lymphomagenesis. Transcriptional profiling of Smc3 haploinsufficient murine
lymphomas revealed downregulation of genes repressed by loss of epigenetic tumor 
suppressors Tet2 and Kmt2d. Profiling 3D chromosomal interactions in lymphomas
revealed impaired enhancer-promoter interactions affecting genes like Tet2, which
was aberrantly downregulated in Smc3 deficient lymphomas. Tet2 plays important
roles in B-cell exit from the GC reaction, and single cell RNA-seq profiles and
phenotypic trajectory analysis in Smc3 mutant mice revealed a specific defect in 
commitment to the final steps of plasma cell differentiation. Although Smc3
deficiency resulted in structural abnormalities in GC B-cells, there was no
increase of somatic mutations or structural variants in Smc3 haploinsufficient
lymphomas, suggesting that cohesin deficiency largely induces lymphomas through
disruption of enhancer-promoter interactions of terminal differentiation and
tumor suppressor genes. Strikingly, the presence of the Smc3 haploinsufficient GC
B-cell transcriptional signature in human patients with GC-derived diffuse large 
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was linked to inferior clinical outcome and low
expression of cohesin core subunits. Reciprocally, reduced expression of cohesin 
subunits was an independent risk factor for worse survival int DLBCL patient
cohorts. Collectively, the data suggest that Smc3 functions as a bona fide tumor 
suppressor for lymphomas through non-genetic mechanisms, and drives disease by
disrupting the commitment of GC B-cells to the plasma cell fate.

BACKGROUND: Children with a low socio-economic position (SEP) participate in
prevention and health examinations less often. In order to increase
participation, reminder systems have been implemented in Germany since 2009. The 
aim of the study is to investigate whether this implementation is associated with
an increased participation in health examination in early childhood for children 
in disadvantaged social circumstances.
METHODS: We used data from the school enrolment examination from 2002 to 2017
from the city of Duesseldorf (n = 64,883 children). With a trend analysis we
observed health examination over time and we compared rates of children after
implementation of the reminder system (2010 or later) to those who were not
exposed to the programme (earlier than 2010). Health examination was measured by 
participation in the last examination before school entry ("U9") documented by
paediatricians. Social circumstances included neighbourhood deprivation (very
high to very low), migration background (foreign first language vs. German) and
family status (one-parent vs. two-parent families). Poisson regression estimated 
adjusted Prevalence Ratios (PR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of U9
participation by reminder system exposure, both for the total population and
within groups of social circumstances. Based on that, we calculated adjusted
participation rates (predictive margins) by reminder system exposure for the
different social circumstances.
RESULTS: Participation rates increased slightly, but gradually over time. The
probability of U9 participation for children exposed to the reminder system is
1.04-fold (1.03-1.04 CI) compared to children who were not exposed to it. The
association of the reminder system and U9 participation differs according to
social circumstances. Adjusted prevalences increased the most in the group of
children from very deprived neighbourhoods, ranging from 84.3 to 91.4%
(PR = 1.07; 1.03-1.10 CI); in all language groups; more in children from
one-parent families ranging from 82.4 to 88.9% (PR = 1.07; 1.05-1.09 CI).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reminder systems have a moderate impact on
the participation in health examinations in early childhood in the general
population. In vulnerable groups, however, they could make a difference. Reminder
systems should be combined with further activities of tailored prevention.

Using ConSurf to Detect Functionally Important Regions in RNA.

Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel.

The ConSurf web server (https://consurf.tau.ac.il/) for using evolutionary data
to detect functional regions is useful for analyzing proteins. The analysis is
based on the premise that functional regions, which may for example facilitate
ligand binding and catalysis, often evolve slowly. The analysis requires finding 
enough effective, i.e., non-redundant, sufficiently remote homologs. Indeed, the 
ConSurf pipeline, which is based on state-of-the-art protein sequence databases
and analysis tools, is highly valuable for protein analysis. ConSurf also allows 
evolutionary analysis of RNA, but the analysis often fails due to insufficient
data, particularly the inability of the current pipeline to detect enough
effective RNA homologs. This is because the RNA search tools and databases
offered are not as good as those used for protein analysis. Fortunately, ConSurf 
also allows importing external collections of homologs in the form of a multiple 
sequence alignment (MSA). Leveraging this, here we describe various protocols for
constructing MSAs for successful ConSurf analysis of RNA queries. We report the
level of success of these protocols on an exemplary set comprising a dozen RNA
molecules of diverse structure and function. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. Basic

RealVS: Toward Enhancing the Precision of Top Hits in Ligand-Based Virtual
Screening of Drug Leads from Large Compound Databases.

Accurate modeling of compound bioactivities is essential for the virtual
screening of drug leads. In real-world scenarios, pharmacists tend to choose from
the top-k hit compounds ranked by predicted bioactivities from a large database
with interest to continue wet experiments for drug discovery. Significant
improvement of the precision of the top hits in ligand-based virtual screening of
drug leads is more valuable than conventional schemes for accurately predicting
the bioactivities of all compounds from a large database. Here, we proposed a new
method, RealVS, to significantly improve the top hits' precision and learn
interpretable key substructures associated with compound bioactivities. The
features of RealVS involve the following points. (1) Abundant transferable
information from the source domain was introduced for alleviating the
insufficiency of inactive ligands associated with drug targets. (2) The
adversarial domain alignment was adopted to fit the distribution of generated
features of compounds from the training data set and that from the screening
database for greater model generalization ability. (3) A novel objective function
was proposed to simultaneously optimize the classification loss, regression loss,
and adversarial loss, where most inactive ligands tend to be screened out before 
activity regression prediction. (4) Graph attention networks were adopted for
learning key substructures associated with ligand bioactivities for better model 
interpretability. The results on a large number of benchmark data sets show that 
our method has significantly improved the precision of top hits under various k
values in ligand-based virtual screening of drug leads from large compound
databases, which is of great value in real-world scenarios. The web server of
RealVS is freely available at noveldelta.com/RealVS for academic purposes, where 
virtual screening of hits from large compound databases is accessible.

Mapping the genealogy of medical device predicates in the United States.

Pai DB(1).

Author information: 
(1)Science, Mathematics and Computer Science Program, Montgomery Blair High
School, Silver Spring, MD, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, medical devices are regulated and subject to
review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can be marketed.
Low-to-medium risk novel medical devices can be reviewed under the De Novo
umbrella before they can proceed to market, and this process can be fairly
cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. An alternate faster and less-expensive
pathway to going to market is the 510(k) pathway. In this approach, if the device
can be shown to be substantially equivalent in safety and effectiveness to a
pre-existing FDA-approved marketed device (or "predicates"), it can be cleared to
market. Due to the possibility of daisy-chaining predicate devices, it can very
quickly be difficult to unravel the logic and justification of how a particular
medical device's equivalence was established. From patients' perspective, this
minimizes transparency in the process. From a vendor perspective, it can be
difficult to determine the right predicate that applies to their device.
METHODS: We map the connectivity of various predicates in the medical device
field by applying text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques on
data publicly made available by the FDA 78000 device summaries were scraped from 
the US FDA 510(k) database, and a total of 2,721 devices cleared by the 510(k)
regulatory pathway in 2020 were used as a specific case study to map the
genealogy of medical devices cleared by the FDA. Cosine similarity was used to
gauge the degree of substantial equivalence between two medical devices by
evaluating their device descriptions and indications for use. Recalls and
complaints for predicate devices were extracted from the FDA's Total Product Life
Cycle database using html scraping and web page optical character recognition to 
determine the similarity between class 1 recalled devices (the most severe form
of device recall) and other substantially equivalent devices. A specific product 
code was used to illustrate the mapping of the genealogy from a De Novo device.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ancestral tree for the medical devices cleared in
2020 is vast and sparse, with a large number of devices having only 1-2
predicates. Evaluation of substantial equivalence data from 2003-2020 shows that 
the standard for substantial equivalence has not changed significantly. Studying 
the recalls and complaints, shows that the insulin infusion pump had the highest 
number of complaints, yet none of the recalled devices bore significant degree of
text similarity to currently marketed devices. The mapping from the De Novo
device case study was used to develop an ancestry map from the recalled predicate
(recalled due to design flaws) to current substantially equivalent products in
the market.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides enabling a better understanding of the risks and benefits of
the 510(k) process, mapping of connectivity of various predicates could help
increase consumer confidence in the medical devices that are currently in the
marketplace.

Correspondence of aCGH and long-read genome assembly for detection of copy number
differences: A proof-of-concept with cichlid genomes.

Copy number variation is an important source of genetic variation, yet data are
often lacking due to technical limitations for detection given the current genome
assemblies. Our goal is to demonstrate the extent to which an array-based
platform (aCGH) can identify genomic loci that are collapsed in genome assemblies
that were built with short-read technology. Taking advantage of two cichlid
species for which genome assemblies based on Illumina and PacBio are available,
we show that inter-species aCGH log2 hybridization ratios correlate more strongly
with inferred copy number differences based on PacBio-built genome assemblies
than based on Illumina-built genome assemblies. With regard to inter-species copy
number differences of specific genes identified by each platform, the set
identified by aCGH intersects to a greater extent with the set identified by
PacBio than with the set identified by Illumina. Gene function, according to Gene
Ontology analysis, did not substantially differ among platforms, and platforms
converged on functions associated with adaptive phenotypes. The results of the
current study further demonstrate that aCGH is an effective platform for
identifying copy number variable sequences, particularly those collapsed in short
read genome assemblies.

Health information technology systems have the capacity to improve health
outcomes for the patients thus ensuring quality and efficient services. Health
information systems (HIS) are important tools in guidance towards patient safety 
and better outcomes. However, still, morbidity and mortality attributed to
medical errors remain an important issue that needs to be addressed. The
objective of the present study was to assess the health information system in
terms of technological, environmental, organizational and human factors affecting
the adoption as well as the perceptions of stakeholders along with barriers and
constraints related to successful implementation. A descriptive cross-sectional
study design was used. Prospective data was collected from primary sources by
self-administering the pre-validated questionnaires as well as by physical
verification of the availability of equipment. After data collection, data was
analyzed to assess the health information management systems. The results of the 
present study showed that the health information system in Pakistan is not up to 
the mark. The equipment was mostly unavailable at the primary healthcare
facilities. The staff was also unsatisfied with the available services.
Administrative, financial and human constraints were identified as the major
barriers towards successful implementation and management of HIS. The present
study concluded that the health information system of Pakistan needs to be
revamped. Health information management system partially existed at district and 
sub-district offices, while was completely absent at tertiary, secondary and
primary healthcare levels. The poor adoption of health information technology
systems at healthcare facilities might largely be attributed to insufficient
human resources with limited resources and budget allocation for health in
Pakistan. Effective and timely strategies involving all important stakeholders
and healthcare professionals must be designed and implemented at the National
level to restructure an affordable, resilient and quality healthcare system.

BACKGROUND: In New York City (NYC), pneumonia is a leading cause of death and
most pneumonia deaths occur in hospitals. Whether the pneumonia death rate in NYC
reflects reporting artifact or is associated with factors during
pneumonia-associated hospitalization (PAH) is unknown. We aimed to identify
hospital-level factors associated with higher than expected in-hospital pneumonia
death rates among adults in NYC.
METHODS: Data from January 1, 2010-December 31, 2014 were obtained from the New
York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System and the American Hospital
Association Database. In-hospital pneumonia standardized mortality ratio (SMR)
was calculated for each hospital as observed PAH death rate divided by expected
PAH death rate. To determine hospital-level factors associated with higher
in-hospital pneumonia SMR, we fit a hospital-level multivariable negative
binomial regression model.
RESULTS: Of 148,172 PAH among adult NYC residents in 39 hospitals during
2010-2014, 20,820 (14.06%) resulted in in-hospital death. In-hospital pneumonia
SMRs varied across NYC hospitals (0.77-1.23) after controlling for patient-level 
factors. An increase in average daily occupancy and membership in the Council of 
Teaching Hospitals were associated with increased in-hospital pneumonia SMR.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in in-hospital pneumonia SMRs between hospitals might
reflect differences in disease severity, quality of care, or coding practices.
More research is needed to understand the association between average daily
occupancy and in-hospital pneumonia SMR. Additional pneumonia-specific training
at teaching hospitals can be considered to address higher in-hospital pneumonia
SMR in teaching hospitals.

BACKGROUND: Men have a higher risk of death from COVID-19 than women and
androgens facilitate entrance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into respiratory epithelial
cells. Thus, androgen deprivation therapy may reduce infection rates and improve 
outcomes for COVID-19. In the spring of 2020, Sweden was highly affected by
COVID-19. The aim was to estimate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on
mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing
all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to that in previous years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden all men with
prostate cancer on March 1 each year in 2015-2020 were followed until June 30 the
same year. Exposure to androgen deprivation therapy was ascertained from filled
prescriptions for bicalutamide monotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonists (GnRH), or bilateral orchidectomy.
RESULTS: A total of 9,822 men died in March-June in the years 2015-2020, of whom 
5,034 men were on androgen deprivation therapy. There was an excess mortality in 
2020 vs previous years in all men. The crude relative mortality rate ratio for
2020 vs 2015-2019 was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.04) in men on 
GnRH, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) in men on bicalutamide monotherapy. After
multivariable adjustment these ratios were attenuated to 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to
1.12) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.12), respectively. When restricting the analysis
to the regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19 or to the time period
between 2 April to 10 June when mortality in 2020 was increased >30% compared to 
previous years, the results were similar to the main analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large national population-based cohort of men with prevalent
prostate cancer, there was no clear evidence in support for an effect of androgen
deprivation therapy on COVID-19 mortality.

In addition to the opportunities posed by the use of Big Data in health, it also 
generates important challenges in the field of research, especially from the
point of view of its management and ethical considerations. The European Union
has been promoting different initiatives that allow the exploitation of this data
in the context of the knowledge economy. The UNESCO Ethics Committee has
identified three ethical principles to take into account regarding the
application of Big Data in Health: independence, privacy and justice. The
protection of privacy and patient safety is questioned in a context where
cybersecurity is far to be complete. In addition, an imbalance in the
exploitation of these data by the public and private sectors could generate
inequalities that would represent a significant problem of social justice. This
article follows a qualitative methodology based on the documentary analysis of
current legislative texts, especially the recently approved General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as non-legislative documents of projects
and parliamentary communications throughout the last two legislatures, with the
aim of analyzing them and evaluating how they conform to the principles outlined 
by UNESCO, especially with respect to the principle of social justice. The most
representative national projects that have started to be adopted are also
reviewed.

pacientes se cuestiona en un contexto en el que la ciberseguridad está lejos de
ser completa. Además, un desequilibrio en la explotación de estos datos por parte
de los sectores público y privado podría generar inequidades que significarían un
problema importante de justicia social. Este artículo sigue una metodología
cualitativa basada en el análisis documental de los textos legislativos vigentes,
especialmente el recientemente aprobado reglamento general de protección de datos
(RGPD), así como documentos no legislativos de proyectos y comunicaciones
parlamentarias a lo largo de las dos últimas legislaturas, con el objetivo es
analizarlas y evaluar cómo se ajustan a los principios esbozados por la UNESCO,
especialmente con respecto al principio de justicia social. También se revisan
los proyectos nacionales más representativos que han empezado a adoptarse.

Objective: Much of the extensive quantitative research linking socio-economic
position (SEP) and health utilizes three common indicators: income, occupation
and education. Existing survey data may enable researchers to include indicators 
of additional forms of capital in their analyses, permitting more nuanced
consideration of the relationship between SEP and health. Our objective was to
identify the breadth of survey questions related to economic, cultural, and
social capital available through Statistics Canada surveys, and the extent to
which those surveys also include health measures. Methods: We compiled a list of 
all population-based Statistics Canada surveys, and developed a broad list of
potential indicators of forms of capital. We systematically searched the surveys 
for those indicators and health measures, analyzing their co-occurrence. Results:
Traditional SEP indicators were present in 73% of surveys containing health
measures, while additional indicators of social and cultural capital were
available in 57%. Conclusion: Existing national survey data represent an
under-exploited opportunity for research examining the relationship between
various forms of capital and health in Canada. Future empirical explorations of
these data could enrich our theoretical understanding of health inequities.

Single-cell transcriptomics can provide quantitative molecular signatures for
large, unbiased samples of the diverse cell types in the brain1-3. With the
proliferation of multi-omics datasets, a major challenge is to validate and
integrate results into a biological understanding of cell-type organization. Here
we generated transcriptomes and epigenomes from more than 500,000 individual
cells in the mouse primary motor cortex, a structure that has an evolutionarily
conserved role in locomotion. We developed computational and statistical methods 
to integrate multimodal data and quantitatively validate cell-type
reproducibility. The resulting reference atlas-containing over 56 neuronal cell
types that are highly replicable across analysis methods, sequencing technologies
and modalities-is a comprehensive molecular and genomic account of the diverse
neuronal and non-neuronal cell types in the mouse primary motor cortex. The atlas
includes a population of excitatory neurons that resemble pyramidal cells in
layer 4 in other cortical regions4. We further discovered thousands of concordant
marker genes and gene regulatory elements for these cell types. Our results
highlight the complex molecular regulation of cell types in the brain and will
directly enable the design of reagents to target specific cell types in the mouse
primary motor cortex for functional analysis.

Mammalian brain cells show remarkable diversity in gene expression, anatomy and
function, yet the regulatory DNA landscape underlying this extensive
heterogeneity is poorly understood. Here we carry out a comprehensive assessment 
of the epigenomes of mouse brain cell types by applying single-nucleus DNA
methylation sequencing1,2 to profile 103,982 nuclei (including 95,815 neurons and
8,167 non-neuronal cells) from 45 regions of the mouse cortex, hippocampus,
striatum, pallidum and olfactory areas. We identified 161 cell clusters with
distinct spatial locations and projection targets. We constructed taxonomies of
these epigenetic types, annotated with signature genes, regulatory elements and
transcription factors. These features indicate the potential regulatory landscape
supporting the assignment of putative cell types and reveal repetitive usage of
regulators in excitatory and inhibitory cells for determining subtypes. The DNA
methylation landscape of excitatory neurons in the cortex and hippocampus varied 
continuously along spatial gradients. Using this deep dataset, we constructed an 
artificial neural network model that precisely predicts single neuron cell-type
identity and brain area spatial location. Integration of high-resolution DNA
methylomes with single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data3 enabled prediction
of high-confidence enhancer-gene interactions for all identified cell types,
which were subsequently validated by cell-type-specific chromatin conformation
capture experiments4. By combining multi-omic datasets (DNA methylation,
chromatin contacts, and open chromatin) from single nuclei and annotating the
regulatory genome of hundreds of cell types in the mouse brain, our DNA
methylation atlas establishes the epigenetic basis for neuronal diversity and
spatial organization throughout the mouse cerebrum.

The enzymes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain are key players of cell
metabolism. Despite being active when isolated, in vivo they associate into
supercomplexes1, whose precise role is debated. Supercomplexes CIII2CIV1-2 (refs.
2,3), CICIII2 (ref. 4) and CICIII2CIV (respirasome)5-10 exist in mammals, but in 
contrast to CICIII2 and the respirasome, to date the only known eukaryotic
structures of CIII2CIV1-2 come from Saccharomyces cerevisiae11,12 and plants13,
which have different organization. Here we present the first, to our knowledge,
structures of mammalian (mouse and ovine) CIII2CIV and its assembly
intermediates, in different conformations. We describe the assembly of CIII2CIV
from the CIII2 precursor to the final CIII2CIV conformation, driven by the
insertion of the N terminus of the assembly factor SCAF1 (ref. 14) deep into
CIII2, while its C terminus is integrated into CIV. Our structures (which include
CICIII2 and the respirasome) also confirm that SCAF1 is exclusively required for 
the assembly of CIII2CIV and has no role in the assembly of the respirasome. We
show that CIII2 is asymmetric due to the presence of only one copy of subunit 9, 
which straddles both monomers and prevents the attachment of a second copy of
SCAF1 to CIII2, explaining the presence of one copy of CIV in CIII2CIV in
mammals. Finally, we show that CIII2 and CIV gain catalytic advantage when
assembled into the supercomplex and propose a role for CIII2CIV in fine tuning
the efficiency of electron transfer in the electron transport chain.

Computational drug repositioning aims at ranking and selecting existing drugs for
novel diseases or novel use in old diseases. In silico drug screening has the
potential for speeding up considerably the shortlisting of promising candidates
in response to outbreaks of diseases such as COVID-19 for which no satisfactory
cure has yet been found. We describe DrugMerge as a methodology for preclinical
computational drug repositioning based on merging multiple drug rankings obtained
with an ensemble of disease active subnetworks. DrugMerge uses differential
transcriptomic data on drugs and diseases in the context of a large gene
co-expression network. Experiments with four benchmark diseases demonstrate that 
our method detects in first position drugs in clinical use for the specified
disease, in all four cases. Application of DrugMerge to COVID-19 found rankings
with many drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 in top positions, thus 
showing that DrugMerge can mimic human expert judgment.

The amount of public proteomics data is rapidly increasing but there is no
standardized format to describe the sample metadata and their relationship with
the dataset files in a way that fully supports their understanding or reanalysis.
Here we propose to develop the transcriptomics data format MAGE-TAB into a
standard representation for proteomics sample metadata. We implement
MAGE-TAB-Proteomics in a crowdsourcing project to manually curate over 200 public
datasets. We also describe tools and libraries to validate and submit sample
metadata-related information to the PRIDE repository. We expect that these
developments will improve the reproducibility and facilitate the reanalysis and
integration of public proteomics datasets.

Rare variants are collectively numerous and may underlie a considerable
proportion of complex disease risk. However, identifying genuine rare variant
associations is challenging due to small effect sizes, presence of technical
artefacts, and heterogeneity in population structure. We hypothesize that rare
variant burden over a large number of genes can be combined into a predictive
rare variant genetic risk score (RVGRS). We propose a method (RV-EXCALIBER) that 
leverages summary-level data from a large public exome sequencing database
(gnomAD) as controls and robustly calibrates rare variant burden to account for
the aforementioned biases. A calibrated RVGRS strongly associates with coronary
artery disease (CAD) in European and South Asian populations by capturing the
aggregate effect of rare variants through a polygenic model of inheritance. The
RVGRS identifies 1.5% of the population with substantial risk of early CAD and
confers risk even when adjusting for known Mendelian CAD genes, clinical risk
factors, and a common variant genetic risk score.

BACKGROUND: Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. & Zucc.) is an important fruit
tree in China, and has high medicinal value. At present, the genome,
transcriptome and germplasm resources of bayberry have been reported. In order to
make more convenient use of these data, the Bayberry Database was established.
RESULTS: The Bayberry Database is a comprehensive and intuitive data platform for
examining the diverse annotated genome and germplasm resources of this species.
This database contains nine central functional domains to interact with multiomic
data: home, genome, germplasm, markers, tools, map, expression, reference, and
contact. All domains provide pathways to a variety of data types composed of a
reference genome sequence, transcriptomic data, gene patterns, phenotypic data,
fruit images of Myrica rubra varieties, gSSR data, gene maps with annotation and 
evolutionary analyses. The tools module includes BLAST search, keyword search,
sequence fetch and enrichment analysis functions.
CONCLUSIONS: The web address of the database is as follows
http://www.bayberrybase.cn/ . The Myrica rubra database is an intelligent,
interactive, and user-friendly system that enables researchers, breeders and
horticultural personnel to browse, search and retrieve relevant and useful
information and thus facilitate genomic research and breeding efforts concerning 
Myrica rubra. This database will be of great help to bayberry research and
breeding in the future.

AANet: Adaptive Attention Network for COVID-19 Detection From Chest X-Ray Images.

Lin Z, He Z, Xie S, Wang X, Tan J, Lu J, Tan B.

Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-ray (CXR) plays an
important role in large-scale screening and epidemic prevention. Unfortunately,
identifying COVID-19 from the CXR images is challenging as its radiographic
features have a variety of complex appearances, such as widespread ground-glass
opacities and diffuse reticular-nodular opacities. To solve this problem, we
propose an adaptive attention network (AANet), which can adaptively extract the
characteristic radiographic findings of COVID-19 from the infected regions with
various scales and appearances. It contains two main components: an adaptive
deformable ResNet and an attention-based encoder. First, the adaptive deformable 
ResNet, which adaptively adjusts the receptive fields to learn feature
representations according to the shape and scale of infected regions, is designed
to handle the diversity of COVID-19 radiographic features. Then, the
attention-based encoder is developed to model nonlocal interactions by
self-attention mechanism, which learns rich context information to detect the
lesion regions with complex shapes. Extensive experiments on several public
datasets show that the proposed AANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Bayesian inference of population prevalence.

Within neuroscience, psychology, and neuroimaging, the most frequently used
statistical approach is null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) of the
population mean. An alternative approach is to perform NHST within individual
participants and then infer, from the proportion of participants showing an
effect, the prevalence of that effect in the population. We propose a novel
Bayesian method to estimate such population prevalence that offers several
advantages over population mean NHST. This method provides a population-level
inference that is currently missing from study designs with small participant
numbers, such as in traditional psychophysics and in precision imaging. Bayesian 
prevalence delivers a quantitative population estimate with associated
uncertainty instead of reducing an experiment to a binary inference. Bayesian
prevalence is widely applicable to a broad range of studies in neuroscience,
psychology, and neuroimaging. Its emphasis on detecting effects within individual
participants can also help address replicability issues in these fields.

plain-language-summary: Scientists use statistical tools to evaluate observations
or measurements from carefully designed experiments. In psychology and
neuroscience, these experiments involve studying a randomly selected group of
people, looking for patterns in their behaviour or brain activity, to infer
things about the population at large. The usual method for evaluating the results
of these experiments is to carry out null hypothesis statistical testing (NHST)
on the population mean – that is, the average effect in the population that the
study participants were selected from. The test asks whether the observed results
in the group studied differ from what might be expected if the average effect in 
the population was zero. However, in psychology and neuroscience studies,
people’s brain activity and performance on cognitive tasks can differ a lot. This
means important effects in individuals can be lost in the overall population
average. Ince et al. propose that this shortcoming of NHST can be overcome by
shifting the statistical analysis away from the population mean, and instead
focusing on effects in individual participants. This led them to create a new
statistical approach named Bayesian prevalence. The method looks at effects
within each individual in the study and asks how likely it would be to see the
same result if the experiment was repeated with a new person chosen from the
wider population at random. Using this approach, it is possible to quantify how
typical or uncommon an observed effect is in the population, and the uncertainty 
around this estimate. This differs from NHST which only provides a binary ‘yes or
no’ answer to the question, ‘does this experiment provide sufficient evidence
that the average effect in the population is not zero?’ Another benefit of
Bayesian prevalence is that it can be applied to studies with small numbers of
participants which cannot be analysed using other statistical methods. Ince et
al. show that the Bayesian prevalence can be applied to a range of psychology and
neuroimaging experiments, from brain imaging to electrophysiology studies. Using 
this alternative statistical method could help address issues of replication in
these fields where NHST results are sometimes not the same when studies are
repeated.

BACKGROUND Effective identification of patients with suspected COVID-19 is vital 
for the management. This study aimed to establish a simple clinical prediction
model for COVID-19 in primary care. MATERIAL AND METHODS We consecutively
enrolled 60 confirmed cases and 152 suspected cases with COVID-19 into the study.
The training cohort consisted of 30 confirmed and 78 suspected cases, whereas the
validation cohort consisted of 30 confirmed and 74 suspected cases. Four clinical
variables - epidemiological history (E), body temperature (T), leukocytes count
(L), and chest computed tomography (C) - were collected to construct a
preliminary prediction model (model A). By integerizing coefficients of model A, 
a clinical prediction model (model B) was constructed. Finally, the scores of
each variable in model B were summed up to build the ETLC score. RESULTS The
preliminary prediction model A was Logit
(YA)=2.657X₁+1.153X₂+2.125X₃+2.828X₄-10.771, while the model B was Logit
(YB)=2.5X₁+1X₂+2X₃+3X₄-10. No significant difference was found between the area
under the curve (AUC) of model A (0.920, 95% CI: 0.875-0.953) and model B (0.919,
95% CI: 0.874-0.952) (Z=0.035, P=0.972). When ETLC score was more than or equal
to 9.5, the sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 was 76.7% (46/60) and 90.1% 
(137/152), respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were
75.4% (46/61) and 90.7% (137/151), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The ETLC score is
helpful for efficiently identifying patients with suspected COVID-19.

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that is
able to generate distant proposals via the use of Hamiltonian dynamics, which are
able to incorporate first-order gradient information about the target posterior. 
This has driven its rise in popularity in the machine learning community in
recent times. It has been shown that making use of the energy-time uncertainty
relation from quantum mechanics, one can devise an extension to HMC by allowing
the mass matrix to be random with a probability distribution instead of a fixed
mass. Furthermore, Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MHMC) has been recently
proposed as an extension to HMC and adds a magnetic field to HMC which results in
non-canonical dynamics associated with the movement of a particle under a
magnetic field. In this work, we utilise the non-canonical dynamics of MHMC while
allowing the mass matrix to be random to create the Quantum-Inspired Magnetic
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (QIMHMC) algorithm, which is shown to converge to the
correct steady state distribution. Empirical results on a broad class of target
posterior distributions show that the proposed method produces better sampling
performance than HMC, MHMC and HMC with a random mass matrix.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: We measured the association between underlying chronic hepatitis
B (CHB) and antiviral use with infection rates among patients who underwent
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing.
METHODS: In total, 204,418 patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 between
January and June 2020 were included. For each case patient (n = 7,723) with a
positive SARS-CoV-2 test, random controls (n = 46,231) were selected from the
target population who had been exposed to someone with coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) but had a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result. We merged claim-based data 
from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database collected. Primary
endpoints were SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19.
RESULTS: The proportion of underlying CHB was lower in COVID-19 positive patients
(n = 267, 3.5%) than in COVID-19 negative controls (n = 2482, 5.4%). Underlying
CHB was associated with a lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate, after adjusting for
comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.57-0.74). Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, underlying CHB tended to
confer a 66% greater risk of severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19, although this 
value was statistically insignificant. Antiviral treatment including tenofovir
and entecavir was associated with a reduced SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate (aOR 0.49;
95% CI, 0.37-0.66), while treatment was not associated with severe clinical
outcomes of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS: Underlying CHB and antiviral agents including tenofovir decreased
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. HBV coinfection did not increase the risk
of disease severity or lead to a worse prognosis in COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: How effective have lockdowns been at reducing the covid-19 infection 
and mortality rates? Lockdowns influence contact among persons within or between 
populations including restricting travel, closing schools, prohibiting public
gatherings, requiring workplace closures, all designed to slow the contagion of
the virus. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of lockdown 
measures on the spread of covid-19 and test a theoretical model of the covid-19
pandemic employing structural equation modelling.
METHODS: Lockdown variables, population demographics, mortality rates, infection 
rates, and health were obtained for eight countries: Austria, Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The dataset,
owid-covid-data.csv, was downloaded on 06/01/2020 from:
https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data. Infection spread
and mortality data were depicted as logistic growth and analyzed with stepwise
multiple regression. The overall structure of the covid-19 data was explored
through factor analyses leading to a theoretical model that was tested using
latent variable path analysis.
RESULTS: Multiple regression indicated that the time from lockdown had a small
but significant effect (β = 0.112, p< 0.01) on reducing the number of cases per
million. The stringency index produced the most important effect for mortality
and infection rates (β = 0.588,β = 0.702, β = 0.518, β = 0.681; p< 0.01).
Exploratory and confirmatory analyses resulted in meaningful and cohesive latent 
variables: 1) Mortality, 2) Infection Spread, 3) Pop Health Risk, and 4) Health
Vulnerability (Comparative Fit Index = 0.91; Standardized Root Mean Square
Residual = 0.08).
DISCUSSION: The stringency index had a large impact on the growth of covid-19
infection and mortality rates as did percentage of population aged over 65,
median age, per capita GDP, diabetes prevalence, cardiovascular death rates, and 
ICU hospital beds per 100K. The overall Latent Variable Path Analysis is
theoretically meaningful and coherent with acceptable fit indices as a model of
the covid-19 pandemic.

In commercial snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery, the catch efficiency of
the conical pots is important for increasing the profitability of the industry.
This study evaluated the effect of adding green and white light emitting diodes
(LED) on the catch efficiency of commercially used conical pots. The results from
the field experiments showed that inserting artificial lights significantly
increases the catch efficiency for snow crab over the minimum landing size of 95 
mm carapace width of up to 76% when using green LED, and by 52-53% on average
when using white LED. This study shows that it is possible to improve the catch
efficiency of the snow crab fishery by applying artificial LED lights to the
conical snow crab pots, potentially resulting in an important economic benefit to
the snow crab fishery.

PURPOSE: The delineation of organs at risk (OARs) is fundamental to cone-beam CT 
(CBCT)-based adaptive radiotherapy treatment planning, but is time consuming,
labor intensive, and subject to interoperator variability. We investigated a deep
learning-based rapid multiorgan delineation method for use in CBCT-guided
adaptive pancreatic radiotherapy.
METHODS: To improve the accuracy of OAR delineation, two innovative solutions
have been proposed in this study. First, instead of directly segmenting organs on
CBCT images, a pretrained cycle-consistent generative adversarial network
(cycleGAN) was applied to generating synthetic CT images given CBCT images.
Second, an advanced deep learning model called mask-scoring regional
convolutional neural network (MS R-CNN) was applied on those synthetic CT to
detect the positions and shapes of multiple organs simultaneously for final
segmentation. The OAR contours delineated by the proposed method were validated
and compared with expert-drawn contours for geometric agreement using the Dice
similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), mean
surface distance (MSD), and residual mean square distance (RMS).
RESULTS: Across eight abdominal OARs including duodenum, large bowel, small
bowel, left and right kidneys, liver, spinal cord, and stomach, the geometric
comparisons between automated and expert contours are as follows: 0.92
(0.89-0.97) mean DSC, 2.90 mm (1.63-4.19 mm) mean HD95, 0.89 mm (0.61-1.36 mm)
mean MSD, and 1.43 mm (0.90-2.10 mm) mean RMS. Compared to the competing methods,
our proposed method had significant improvements (p < 0.05) in all the metrics
for all the eight organs. Once the model was trained, the contours of eight OARs 
can be obtained on the order of seconds.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of a synthetic CT-aided deep
learning framework for automated delineation of multiple OARs on CBCT. The
proposed method could be implemented in the setting of pancreatic adaptive
radiotherapy to rapidly contour OARs with high accuracy.

varian linear accelerators.

There are several methods available in the literature for predicting the insert
factor for clinical electron beams. The purpose of this work was to build on a
previously published technique that uses a bivariate spline model generated from 
elliptically parameterized empirical measurements. The technique has been
previously validated for Elekta linear accelerators for limited clinical electron
setups. The same model is applied to Varian machines to test its efficacy for use
with these linear accelerators. Insert factors for specifically designed
elliptical cutouts were measured to create spline models for 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20
MeV electron energies for four different cone sizes at source-to-surface
distances (SSD) of 100, 105, and 110 cm. Insert factor validation measurements of
patient cutouts and clinical standard cutouts were acquired to compare to model
predictions. Agreement between predicted insert factors and validation
measurements averaged 0.8% over all energies, cones, and clinical SSDs, with an
uncertainty of 0.6% (1SD), and maximum deviation of 2.1%. The model demonstrated 
accurate predictions of insert factors using the minimum required amount of input
data for small cones, with more input measurements required for larger cones. The
results of this study provide expanded validation of this technique to predict
insert factors for all energies, cones, and SSDs that would be used in most
clinical situations. This level of accuracy and the ease of creating the model
necessary for the insert factor predictions demonstrate its acceptability to use 
clinically for Varian machines.

proton irradiation.

PURPOSE: To measure diode sensitivity degradation (DSD) induced by cumulative
proton dose delivered to a commercial daily quality assurance (QA) device.
METHODS: At our institution, six Daily QA 3 (DQA3, Sun Nuclear Corporation,
Melbourne, FL, USA) devices have been used for daily proton pencil beam scanning 
QA in four proton gantry rooms over a span of 4 years. DQA3 diode counts were
cross-calibrated using a homogenous field with a known dose of 1 Gy. The DSD rate
(ΔR%/100 Gy) was calculated using linear regression on time-series plots of diode
counts and an estimate of cumulative dose per year based on the
cross-calibration. The effect of DSD on daily QA spot position measurements was
quantified by converting DSD to baseline spot position shift.
RESULTS: The average dose delivered to the four inner DQA3 diodes was
104 ± 5 Gy/year, and the rate of DSD was -5.1% ± 1.0/100 Gy with the exception of
one DQA3 device that had a significantly higher rate of DSD (-12%/100 Gy). The R2
s of the linear fit to time-series plots were between 0.92 and 0.98. The DSD
rates were not constant but decreases with accumulated doses. The four center
diodes, which received 40% of the cumulative dose received by inner diodes, had a
DSD rate of -7.2% ± 0.9/100 Gy. For our daily QA program, 1 year of DSD was
equivalent to a 0.2 mm shift in spot position.
CONCLUSIONS: The DSD rate of DQA3 diodes determined by long-term proton daily QA 
data was about -5%/100 Gy, which is more than 10 times greater than the reported 
DSD rate from photon irradiation. DQA3 diodes may be used for daily proton QA
programs, provided that they are recalibrated at an appropriate frequency that
should be determined specifically for different daily QA programs.

In the context of a recent massive increase in research on plant root functions
and their impact on the environment, root ecologists currently face many
important challenges to keep on generating cutting-edge, meaningful and
integrated knowledge. Consideration of the below-ground components in plant and
ecosystem studies has been consistently called for in recent decades, but
methodology is disparate and sometimes inappropriate. This handbook, based on the
collective effort of a large team of experts, will improve trait comparisons
across studies and integration of information across databases by providing
standardised methods and controlled vocabularies. It is meant to be used not only
as starting point by students and scientists who desire working on below-ground
ecosystems, but also by experts for consolidating and broadening their views on
multiple aspects of root ecology. Beyond the classical compilation of measurement
protocols, we have synthesised recommendations from the literature to provide key
background knowledge useful for: (1) defining below-ground plant entities and
giving keys for their meaningful dissection, classification and naming beyond the
classical fine-root vs coarse-root approach; (2) considering the specificity of
root research to produce sound laboratory and field data; (3) describing typical,
but overlooked steps for studying roots (e.g. root handling, cleaning and
storage); and (4) gathering metadata necessary for the interpretation of results 
and their reuse. Most importantly, all root traits have been introduced with some
degree of ecological context that will be a foundation for understanding their
ecological meaning, their typical use and uncertainties, and some methodological 
and conceptual perspectives for future research. Considering all of this, we urge
readers not to solely extract protocol recommendations for trait measurements
from this work, but to take a moment to read and reflect on the extensive
information contained in this broader guide to root ecology, including sections
I-VII and the many introductions to each section and root trait description.
Finally, it is critical to understand that a major aim of this guide is to help
break down barriers between the many subdisciplines of root ecology and
ecophysiology, broaden researchers' views on the multiple aspects of root study
and create favourable conditions for the inception of comprehensive experiments
on the role of roots in plant and ecosystem functioning.

How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major
unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend
on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression
prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning
architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from
long-range interactions (up to 100 kb away) in the genome. This improvement
yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both
natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively
parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict
enhancer-promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with 
methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these
advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations
and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.

Generative models emerge as promising candidates for novel sequence-data driven
approaches to protein design, and for the extraction of structural and functional
information about proteins deeply hidden in rapidly growing sequence databases.
Here we propose simple autoregressive models as highly accurate but
computationally efficient generative sequence models. We show that they perform
similarly to existing approaches based on Boltzmann machines or deep generative
models, but at a substantially lower computational cost (by a factor between 102 
and 103). Furthermore, the simple structure of our models has distinctive
mathematical advantages, which translate into an improved applicability in
sequence generation and evaluation. Within these models, we can easily estimate
both the probability of a given sequence, and, using the model's entropy, the
size of the functional sequence space related to a specific protein family. In
the example of response regulators, we find a huge number of ca. 1068 possible
sequences, which nevertheless constitute only the astronomically small fraction
10-80 of all amino-acid sequences of the same length. These findings illustrate
the potential and the difficulty in exploring sequence space via generative
sequence models.

Our organization, Black in Immuno (@BlackInImmuno), was formed in September 2020 
to celebrate, support, and amplify Black voices in immunology when social media
campaigns like #BlackInTheIvory illuminated the shared overt and covert issues of
systemic racism faced by Black researchers in all facets of science, technology, 
engineering, art, and mathematics. Black in Immuno was cofounded by a group of
Black immunology trainees working at multiple institutions globally: Joël Babdor,
E. Evonne Jean, Elaine Kouame, Alexis S. Mobley, Justine C. Noel, and Madina
Wane. We devised Black in Immuno Week, held November 22-28, 2020, as a global
celebration of Black immunologists. The week was designed to advocate for
increased diversity and accessibility in immunology, amplify Black excellence in 
immunology, and create a community of Black immunologists who can support each
other to flourish despite barriers in academia and other job sectors. The week
contained live panels and scientific talks, a casual networking mixer, online
advocacy and amplification sessions, and a series of wellness events. Our
live-streamed programs reached over 300 individuals, and thousands of people kept
the conversations going globally using #BlackInImmuno and #BlackInImmunoWeek on
social media from five continents. Below, we highlight the events and significant
takeaways of the week.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning methods are a proven commodity in many fields and
endeavors. One of these endeavors is predicting the presence of adverse drug-drug
interactions (DDIs). The models generated can predict, with reasonable accuracy, 
the phenotypes arising from the drug interactions using their molecular
structures. Nevertheless, this task requires improvement to be truly useful.
Given the complexity of the predictive task, an extensive benchmarking on
structure-based models for DDIs prediction was performed to evaluate their
drawbacks and advantages.
RESULTS: We rigorously tested various structure-based models that predict drug
interactions using different splitting strategies to simulate different
real-world scenarios. In addition to the effects of different training and
testing setups on the robustness and generalizability of the models, we then
explore the contribution of traditional approaches such as multitask learning and
data augmentation.
CONCLUSION: Structure-based models tend to generalize poorly to unseen drugs
despite their ability to identify new DDIs among drugs seen during training
accurately. Indeed, they efficiently propagate information between known drugs
and could be valuable for discovering new DDIs in a database. However, these
models will most probably fail when exposed to unknown drugs. While multitask
learning does not help in our case to solve the problem, the use of data
augmentation does at least mitigate it. Therefore, researchers must be cautious
of the bias of the random evaluation scheme, especially if their goal is to
discover new DDIs.

BACKGROUND: Blood cancers (BCs) are responsible for over 720 K yearly deaths
worldwide. Their prevalence and mortality-rate uphold the relevance of research
related to BCs. Despite the availability of different resources establishing
Disease-Disease Associations (DDAs), the knowledge is scattered and not
accessible in a straightforward way to the scientific community. Here, we propose
SicknessMiner, a biomedical Text-Mining (TM) approach towards the centralization 
of DDAs. Our methodology encompasses Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named
Entity Normalization (NEN) steps, and the DDAs retrieved were compared to the
DisGeNET resource for qualitative and quantitative comparison.
RESULTS: We obtained the DDAs via co-mention using our SicknessMiner or gene- or 
variant-disease similarity on DisGeNET. SicknessMiner was able to retrieve around
92% of the DisGeNET results and nearly 15% of the SicknessMiner results were
specific to our pipeline.
CONCLUSIONS: SicknessMiner is a valuable tool to extract disease-disease
relationship from RAW input corpus.

BACKGROUND: Identifying interaction effects between genes is one of the main
tasks of genome-wide association studies aiming to shed light on the biological
mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Multifactor dimensionality reduction
(MDR) is a popular approach for detecting gene-gene interactions that has been
extended in various forms to handle binary and continuous phenotypes. However,
only few multivariate MDR methods are available for multiple related phenotypes. 
Current approaches use Hotelling's T2 statistic to evaluate interaction models,
but it is well known that Hotelling's T2 statistic is highly sensitive to heavily
skewed distributions and outliers.
RESULTS: We propose a robust approach based on nonparametric statistics such as
spatial signs and ranks. The new multivariate rank-based MDR (MR-MDR) is mainly
suitable for analyzing multiple continuous phenotypes and is less sensitive to
skewed distributions and outliers. MR-MDR utilizes fuzzy k-means clustering and
classifies multi-locus genotypes into two groups. Then, MR-MDR calculates a
spatial rank-sum statistic as an evaluation measure and selects the best
interaction model with the largest statistic. Our novel idea lies in adopting
nonparametric statistics as an evaluation measure for robust inference. We adopt 
tenfold cross-validation to avoid overfitting. Intensive simulation studies were 
conducted to compare the performance of MR-MDR with current methods. Application 
of MR-MDR to a real dataset from a Korean genome-wide association study
demonstrated that it successfully identified genetic interactions associated with
four phenotypes related to kidney function. The R code for conducting MR-MDR is
available at https://github.com/statpark/MR-MDR .
CONCLUSIONS: Intensive simulation studies comparing MR-MDR with several current
methods showed that the performance of MR-MDR was outstanding for skewed
distributions. Additionally, for symmetric distributions, MR-MDR showed
comparable power. Therefore, we conclude that MR-MDR is a useful multivariate
non-parametric approach that can be used regardless of the phenotype
distribution, the correlations between phenotypes, and sample size.

BACKGROUND: Electronic health record (EHR) data is commonly used for secondary
purposes such as research and clinical decision support. However, reuse of EHR
data presents several challenges including but not limited to identifying all
diagnoses associated with a patient's clinical encounter. The purpose of this
study was to assess the feasibility of developing a schema to identify and
subclassify all structured diagnosis codes for a patient encounter.
METHODS: To develop a subclassification schema we used EHR data from an
interhospital transport data repository that contained complete hospital
encounter level data. Eight discrete data sources containing structured diagnosis
codes were identified. Diagnosis codes were normalized using the Unified Medical 
Language System and additional EHR data were combined with standardized
terminologies to create and validate the subcategories. We then employed random
forest to assess the usefulness of the new subcategorized diagnoses to predict
post-interhospital transfer mortality by building 2 models, one using standard
diagnosis codes, and one using the new subcategorized diagnosis codes.
RESULTS: Six subcategories of diagnoses were identified and validated. The
subcategories included: primary or admitting diagnoses (10%), past medical,
surgical or social history (9%), problem list (20%), comorbidity (24%), discharge
diagnoses (6%), and unmapped diagnoses (31%). The subcategorized model
outperformed the standard model, achieving a training AUROC of 0.97 versus 0.95
and testing model AUROC of 0.81 versus 0.46.
DISCUSSION: Our work demonstrates that merging structured diagnosis codes with
additional EHR data and secondary data sources provides additional information to
understand the role of diagnosis throughout a clinical encounter and improves
predictive model performance. Further work is necessary to assess if
subcategorizing produces benefits in interpreting the results of prognostic
models and/or operationalizing the results in clinical decision support
applications.

Hepatitis B (HB) is a globally prevalent infectious disease caused by the HB
virus. Xiaochaihu decoction (XCHD) is a classic herbal formula with a long
history of clinical application in treating HB. Although the anti-HB activity of 
XCHD has been reported, systematic research on the exact mechanism of action is
lacking. Here, a network pharmacology-based approach was used to predict the
active components, important targets, and potential mechanism of XCHD in HB
treatment. Investigation included drug-likeness evaluation; absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) screening; protein-protein
interaction (PPI) network construction and cluster analysis; Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis; and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation.
Molecular docking was adopted to investigate the interaction between important
target proteins and active components. Eighty-seven active components of XCHD and
155 anti-HB targets were selected for further analysis. The GO enrichment and
similarity analysis results indicated that XCHD might perform similar or the same
GO functions. Glycyrrhizae Radix (GR), one of the seven XCHD herbs, likely exerts
some unique GO functions such as the regulation of interleukin-12 production,
positive regulation of interleukin-1 beta secretion, and regulation of the
I-kappaB/NF-kappaB complex. The PPI network and KEGG pathway analysis results
showed that XCHD affects HB mainly through modulating pathways related to viral
infection, immunity, cancer, signal transduction, and metabolism. Additionally,
molecular docking verified that the active compounds (quercetin, chrysin, and
capsaicin) could bind with the key targets. This work systematically explored the
anti-HB mechanism of XCHD and provides a novel perspective for future
pharmacological research.

OBJECTIVES: Post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) in locally advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) has historically been associated with toxicity.
Conformal techniques like intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) have the
potential to reduce acute and long-term toxicity from radiation therapy. Among
patients receiving PORT for LA-NSCLC, we identified factors associated with
receipt of IMRT and evaluated the association between IMRT and toxicity.
METHODS: We queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare database between January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2014 to identify
patients diagnosed with Stage II or III NSCLC and who received upfront surgery
and subsequent PORT. Baseline differences between patients receiving
3-dimentional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) and IMRT were assessed using
the chi-squared test for proportions and the t-test for means. Multivariable
logistic regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of IMRT and
pulmonary, esophageal, and cardiac toxicity. Propensity-score matching was
employed to reduce the effect of known confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 620 patients met the inclusion criteria, among whom 441
(71.2%) received 3D-CRT and 179 (28.8%) received IMRT. The mean age of the cohort
was 73.9 years and 54.7% were male. The proportion of patients receiving IMRT
increased from 6.2% in 2006 to 41.4% in 2014 (P < 0.001). IMRT was not associated
with decreased pulmonary (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.62-1.29), esophageal (OR 1.09; 95%
CI, 0.0.75-1.58), or cardiac toxicity (OR 1.02; 95% CI, 0.69-1.51). These
findings held on propensity-score matching. Clinical risk factors including
comorbidity and prior treatment history were associated with treatment toxicity.
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of elderly patients, the use of IMRT in the setting of
PORT for LA-NSCLC was not associated with a difference in toxicity compared to
3D-CRT. This finding suggests that outcomes from PORT may be independent of
radiotherapy treatment technique.

PURPOSE: In radiotherapy (RT), the planning CT (pCT) is commonly used to plan the
full RT-course. Due to organ deformation and motion, the organ shapes seen at the
pCT will not be identical to their shapes during RT. Any difference between the
pCT organ shape and the organ's mean shape during RT will cause systematic
errors. We propose to use statistical shrinkage estimation to reduce this error
using only the pCT and the population mean shape computed from training data.
METHODS: The method was evaluated for the rectum in a cohort of 37 prostate
cancer patients that had a pCT and 7-10 treatment CTs with rectum delineations.
Deformable registration was performed both within-patient and between patients,
resulting in point-to-point correspondence between all rectum shapes, which
enabled us to compute a population mean rectum. Shrinkage estimates were found by
combining the pCTs linearly with the population mean. The method was trained and 
evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation. The shrinkage estimates and the
patient mean shapes were compared geometrically using the Dice similarity index
(DSI), Hausdorff distance (HD), and bidirectional local distance. Clinical
dose/volume histograms, equivalent uniform dose (EUD) and minimum dose to the
hottest 5% volume (D5%) were compared for the shrinkage estimate and the pCT.
RESULTS: The method resulted in moderate but statistically significant increase
in similarity to the patient mean shape over the pCT. On average, the HD was
reduced from 15.6 to 13.4 mm, while the DSI was increased from 0.74 to 0.78.
Significant reduction in the bias of volume estimates was found in the DVH-range 
of 52.5-65 Gy, where the bias was reduced from -1.3 to -0.2 percentage points,
but no significant improvement was found in EUD or D5%, CONCLUSIONS: The results 
suggest that shrinkage estimation can reduce systematic errors due to organ
deformations in RT. The method has potential to increase the accuracy in RT of
deformable organs and can improve motion modeling.

OBJECTIVE: Dupilumab (Dupixent®) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 and 
IL-13 signaling used for the treatment of allergic diseases. Whilst biologic
therapy is traditionally regarded as immunosuppressive and capable to increase
the infectious risk, Dupilumab does not display these characteristics and may be 
even protective in certain cases. We investigated the link between Dupilumab
therapy and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a comprehensive data mining and
disproportionality analysis of the WHO global pharmacovigilance database. One
asymptomatic COVID-19 case, 106 cases of symptomatic COVID-19, and 2 cases of
severe COVID-19 pneumonia were found.
RESULTS: Dupilumab treated patients were at higher risk of COVID-19 (with an
IC0.25 of 3.05), even though infections were less severe (IC0.25 of -1.71). The
risk of developing COVID-19 was significant both among males and females (with an
IC0.25 of 0.24 and 0.58, respectively). The risk of developing COVID-19 was
significant in the age-group of 45-64 years (with an IC0.25 of 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Dupilumab use seems to reduce COVID-19 related severity. Further
studies are needed to better understand the immunological mechanisms and clinical
implications of these findings. Remarkably, the heterogenous nature of the
reports and the database structure did not allow to establish a cause-effect
link, but only an epidemiologically decreased risk in the patients subset treated
with dupilumab.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. According to 
GLOBOCAN estimates, there were 341,831 deaths from cervical cancer in 185
countries in 2020. The aim of this study was to compare equieffective dose (EQD2)
at 2 Gy per fraction by using dose volume histograms (DVHs) derived from external
beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BRT) treatment
plans used in cervical cancer radiotherapy.
METHODS: Fifteen patients with stage IIB-IIIB cervical cancer were included in
this retrospective study. Treatment with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
(3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was planned for all patients 
in 28 fractions, with a total of 50.4 Gy to be delivered to the whole pelvic
region. After EBRT, manual optimization (MO) or inverse optimization (IO) HDR-BRT
plans were created in 4 fractions with a total of 28 Gy. The plans obtained were 
grouped as IMRT + IO, IMRT + MO, 3DCRT + IO, and 3DCRT + MO by calculating EQD2s 
among these plans. D90, D95, and D98 values were compared in all plans for CTVHR 
total EQD2. In addition, EQD2 values ​for critical organs at risk (OARs) such as 
rectum, bladder, small intestine, and sigmoid were compared in all plans for
volumes of 2 cm3, 1 cm3, and 0.1 cm3, respectively.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in
terms of CTVHR D90 and CTVIR D90 values; However, CTVHR D95 (p = 0.000) and CTVHR
D98 (p = 0.000) values ​were found to be better in IMRT + IO technique. The IMRT 
+ IO technique provided better protection for 2 cm3, 1 cm3, and 0.1 cm3 volumes
of OARs compared to other techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: Considering all parameters such as CTVHR, CTVIR, rectum, bladder,
small intestine, and sigmoid, combination of IMRT + IO treatment option was found
to be significantly superior in total EQD2 calculations compared to other plans.

The paper presents a recommendation model for developing new smart city and smart
health projects. The objective is to provide recommendations to citizens about
smart city and smart health startups to improve entrepreneurship and leadership. 
These recommendations may lead to the country's advancement and the improvement
of national income and reduce unemployment. This work focuses on designing and
implementing an approach for processing and analyzing tweets inclosing data
related to smart city and smart health startups and providing recommended
projects as well as their required skills and competencies. This approach is
based on tweets mining through a machine learning method, the Word2Vec algorithm,
combined with a recommendation technique conducted via an ontology-based method. 
This approach allows discovering the relevant startup projects in the context of 
smart cities and makes links to the needed skills and competencies of users. A
system was implemented to validate this approach. The attained performance
metrics related to precision, recall, and F-measure are, respectively, 95%, 66%, 
and 79%, showing that the results are very encouraging.

In order to explore the quality management efficiency of applying big data and
artificial intelligence in nursing quality index, a method of building a nursing 
management platform integrating nursing indicators and nursing events is
proposed. Based on the investigation of the application demand of nursing
information system, the method achieves timely data sharing and transmission
through WLAN technology and realizes nursing management monitoring, nursing
quality index enquiry, and automatic statistical analysis under the vertical
management mode of nursing. The results showed that 77 people (73%) thought the
time decreased, 19 people (18%) thought the time was the same, and 9 people (7%) 
thought the time increased. In terms of intelligent application and big data of
nursing information management system, there is a significant difference in
nursing management efficiency before and after using nursing management
information system (P < 0.001). The nursing management control platform is
designed and applied, and the nursing quality control method and actual
management process are improved, which is very good for strengthening nursing
quality management. The overall optimization of the quality control process is
realized, which helps to mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of nursing staff 
and continuously improve the effectiveness of nursing management and nursing
efficiency.

Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration via Bayesian Network-Based
Knowledge Extraction.

Technology, Changsha, China.

Reinforcement learning from demonstration (RLfD) is considered to be a promising 
approach to improve reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging expert
demonstrations as the additional decision-making guidance. However, most existing
RLfD methods only regard demonstrations as low-level knowledge instances under a 
certain task. Demonstrations are generally used to either provide additional
rewards or pretrain the neural network-based RL policy in a supervised manner,
usually resulting in poor generalization capability and weak robustness
performance. Considering that human knowledge is not only interpretable but also 
suitable for generalization, we propose to exploit the potential of
demonstrations by extracting knowledge from them via Bayesian networks and
develop a novel RLfD method called Reinforcement Learning from demonstration via 
Bayesian Network-based Knowledge (RLBNK). The proposed RLBNK method takes
advantage of node influence with the Wasserstein distance metric (NIW) algorithm 
to obtain abstract concepts from demonstrations and then a Bayesian network
conducts knowledge learning and inference based on the abstract data set, which
will yield the coarse policy with corresponding confidence. Once the coarse
policy's confidence is low, another RL-based refine module will further optimize 
and fine-tune the policy to form a (near) optimal hybrid policy. Experimental
results show that the proposed RLBNK method improves the learning efficiency of
corresponding baseline RL algorithms under both normal and sparse reward
settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our RLBNK method delivers better
generalization capability and robustness than baseline methods.

Feature Selection and Feature Stability Measurement Method for High-Dimensional
Small Sample Data Based on Big Data Technology.

443002, China.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence in recent years, the
research on image processing, text mining, and genome informatics has gradually
deepened, and the mining of large-scale databases has begun to receive more and
more attention. The objects of data mining have also become more complex, and the
data dimensions of mining objects have become higher and higher. Compared with
the ultra-high data dimensions, the number of samples available for analysis is
too small, resulting in the production of high-dimensional small sample data.
High-dimensional small sample data will bring serious dimensional disasters to
the mining process. Through feature selection, redundancy and noise features in
high-dimensional small sample data can be effectively eliminated, avoiding
dimensional disasters and improving the actual efficiency of mining algorithms.
However, the existing feature selection methods emphasize the classification or
clustering performance of the feature selection results and ignore the stability 
of the feature selection results, which will lead to unstable feature selection
results, and it is difficult to obtain real and understandable features. Based on
the traditional feature selection method, this paper proposes an ensemble feature
selection method, Random Bits Forest Recursive Clustering Eliminate (RBF-RCE)
feature selection method, combined with multiple sets of basic classifiers to
carry out parallel learning and screen out the best feature classification
results, optimizes the classification performance of traditional feature
selection methods, and can also improve the stability of feature selection. Then,
this paper analyzes the reasons for the instability of feature selection and
introduces a feature selection stability measurement method, the Intersection
Measurement (IM), to evaluate whether the feature selection process is stable.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on several
groups of high-dimensional small sample data sets.

The purpose of knowledge graph entity disambiguation is to match the ambiguous
entities to the corresponding entities in the knowledge graph. Current entity
ambiguity elimination methods usually use the context information of the entity
and its attributes to obtain the mention embedding vector, compare it with the
candidate entity embedding vector for similarity, and perform entity matching
through the similarity. The disadvantage of this type of method is that it
ignores the structural characteristics of the knowledge graph where the entity is
located, that is, the connection between the entity and the entity, and therefore
cannot obtain the global semantic features of the entity. To improve the
Precision and Recall of entity disambiguation problems, we propose the EDEGE
(Entity Disambiguation based on Entity and Graph Embedding) method, which
utilizes the semantic embedding vector of entity relationship and the embedding
vector of subgraph structure feature. EDEGE first trains the semantic vector of
the entity relationship, then trains the graph structure vector of the subgraph
where the entity is located, and balances the weights of these two vectors
through the entity similarity function. Finally, the balanced vector is input
into the graph neural network, and the matching between the entities is output to
achieve entity disambiguation. Extensive experimental results proved the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Among them, on the ACE2004 data set, the
Precision, Recall, and F1 values of EDEGE are 9.2%, 7%, and 11.2% higher than
baseline methods.

Lancashire, UK.

Recently there has been increased interest in the use and development of virtual 
clinics, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to provide
clinical care, while minimising patient interaction, has led to wider adoption of
both telephone and online consultations, with the potential complications and
pitfalls that accompany such a change in practice. A literature search was
performed using the Pubmed, MEDLINE and Embase databases, from database inception
up to 25 January 2021. A total of 21 papers were identified as discussing virtual
clinical assessment and the medicolegal implications. The main areas of concern
included consent, misdiagnosis, lack of physical examination, privacy and patient
satisfaction. This article assesses these areas and suggests techniques to
address them.

Chemoradiotherapy under Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy Mode for Locally
Advanced Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma.

Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.

INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) originates from the mucous
epithelium of the nasopharynx. Although induction chemotherapy plus concurrent
chemoradiotherapy is the major therapeutic protocol used for locally advanced NPC
without metastasis, more research studies are needed to evaluate the curative
effects. We aim to identify the therapeutic effects and prognosis after induction
chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of locally
advanced NPC under the intensity-modulated radiotherapy mode.
METHODS: The patients (N = 544) with locally advanced NPC (III and Iva, UICC 8th)
after intensity-modulated radiotherapy with induction chemotherapy and concurrent
chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. We analyzed the characteristics of
patients including gender, age, smoking status, tumor node staging system,
clinical stage, pathological type, the therapy protocol of induction chemotherapy
and concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy prescription.
RESULTS: We have found the 5-year survival rates of overall survival (OS),
progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), and 
distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) were 85.21%, 78.51%, 90.71%, and 85.21%
in follow-up, and these data indicated that our therapeutic procedure provided
beneficial effects on survival rates. Subsequently, the chemotherapy drug based
on docetaxel (DOC) provided a more beneficial effect on survival rate compared
with taxol (TXT) (all estimated HR >1; p = 0.005, 0.004, and <0.001 of OS, PFS,
and DMFS), but there was no significant difference between chemotherapy drugs
based on cisplatin (DDP) and nedaplatin (NDP) in treating NPC patients (p =
0.390, 0.549, 0.364, and 0.645 of OS, PFS, LRRFS, and DMFS). The therapeutic
effects of induction chemotherapy revealed no difference between TPF and TP (T:
DOC or TXT, P: DDP or NDP, and F: 5-fluorouracil) (p = 0.541, 0.897, 0.498, and
0.765 of OS, PFS, LRRFS, and DMFS). In addition, there was also no significant
change between concurrent chemotherapy with TP dual drugs or a single platinum
drug (being excluded in the multivariate model using forward [Wald] procedure).
Moreover, the survival rate showed no difference between platinum accumulation
dose of more or less than 150 mg/m2 for concurrent chemotherapy (being excluded
in the multivariate model using forward [Wald] procedure).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that induction chemotherapy plus concurrent
chemoradiotherapy under intensity-modulated radiotherapy which is the standard
therapeutic method for locally advanced NPC provides beneficial therapeutic
effects, and it is worthy of further study.

Removing vegetation cover from hill-slope land increases risk for soil erosion
and delivery of sediment to waterways. In New Zealand's productive landscapes,
clear-fell harvesting of forestry blocks and winter forage grazing by
agricultural livestock are two significant causes of vegetation removal. Bare
ground exposed by these activities varies annually and seasonally in location and
spatial extent. Modelling soil erosion therefore requires temporally and
spatially explicit mapping of this bare ground. We have developed an automated
mapping method using time-series satellite imagery, thereby enabling wide-area
coverage and ease of updating. The temporal analysis identifies land use along
with the period of vegetation removal. It produces results per land parcel (in
vector format) for use in a Geographic Information System. We present a
description of our method, national maps and statistics of bare ground extent in 
New Zealand's hill-country forestry and winter forage grazing land in 2018, and
an assessment of accuracy. The attributes of the mapped land parcels are designed
for input into a soil erosion estimation model such as the New Zealand Universal 
Soil Loss Equation.

Although abdominal pain is a common chief complaint in the emergency department, 
only 1 in 6 patients with abdominal pain are diagnosed with a gastrointestinal
(GI) emergency. These patients often undergo extensive testing as well as
hospitalizations to rule out an acute GI emergency and there is evidence that not
all patients benefit from such management. Several clinical decision rules (CDRs)
have been developed for the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected
acute appendicitis and upper GI bleeding to identify those patients who may
safely forgo further testing or hospital admission. Further validation studies
demonstrating the superiority of these CDRs over contemporary practice are
needed.

BACKGROUND: Genetic testing has potential roles in identifying whether an
individual would have risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from a particular
medicine. Robust cost-effectiveness results on genetic testing would be useful
for clinical practice and policy decision-making on allocating resources
effectively. This study aimed to update a systematic review on economic
evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing to prevent ADRs and critically appraise
the quality of reporting and sources of evidence for model input parameters.
METHODS: We searched studies through Medline via PubMed, Scopus and CRD's NHS
Economic Evaluation up to October 2019. Studies investigating polymorphism-based 
pharmacogenetic testing, which guided drug therapies to prevent ADRs, using
economic evaluation methods were included. Two reviewers independently performed 
data extraction and assessed the quality of reporting using the Consolidated
Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) guidelines and the
quality of data sources using the hierarchy of evidence developed by Cooper et
al. RESULTS: Fifty-nine economic evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing to avoid 
drug-induced ADRs were found between 2002 and 2018. Cost-utility and
cost-effectiveness analyses were the most common methods of economic evaluation
of pharmacogenetic testing. Most studies complied with the CHEERS checklist,
except for single study-based economic evaluations which did not report
uncertainty analysis (78%). There was a lack of high-quality evidence not only
for estimating the clinical effectiveness of pharmacogenetic testing, but also
baseline clinical data. About 14% of the studies obtained clinical effectiveness 
data of testing from a meta-analysis of case-control studies with direct
comparison, which was not listed in the hierarchy of evidence used.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggested that future single study-based economic
evaluations of pharmacogenetic testing should report uncertainty analysis, as
this could significantly affect the robustness of economic evaluation results. A 
specific ranking system for the quality of evidence is needed for the economic
evaluation of pharmacogenetic testing of ADRs. Differences in parameters, methods
and outcomes across studies, as well as population-level and system-level
differences, may lead to the difficulty of comparing cost-effectiveness results
across countries.

PURPOSE: To investigate the dosimetric impact of changes in the large bowel
content during proton therapy (PT) with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for
locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with LAPC were included in this study.
The SIB method was performed using five fields according to our standard
protocol. A total dose of 67.5 Gy(relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) was
prescribed in 25 fractions using the SIB method. A dose of 45 Gy(RBE) was
prescribed for the entire planning target volume (PTV) by using four main fields.
The remaining 22.5 Gy(RBE) was prescribed to the PTV excluding for the
gastrointestinal tract using one subfield. Five simulated doses were obtained by 
the forward dose calculations with the Hounsfield units (HU) override to the
large bowel to 50, 0, -100, -500, and -1000, respectively. The dose-volume
indices in each plan were compared using the 50 HU plan as a reference.
RESULTS: At D98 of the clinical target volume (CTV) and spinal cord-D2cc , when
the density of the large bowel was close to that of gas, there were significant
differences compared to the reference plan (p < 0.05). By contrast, no
significant difference was observed in stomach-D2cc duodenum-D2cc , small
bowel-D2cc , kidneys-V18 , and liver-Dmean under any of the conditions. There
were no cases in which the dose constraint of organs at risk, specified by our
institution, was exceeded.
CONCLUSION: Density change in the large bowel was revealed to significantly
affect the doses of the CTV and spinal cord during PT with SIB for LAPC. For beam
arrangement, it is important to select a gantry angle that prevents the large
bowel from passing as much as possible. If this is unavoidable, it is important
to carefully observe the gas image on the beam path during daily image guidance
and to provide adaptive re-planning as needed.

Introduction: Auto-immune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare condition which primarily
affects young women. Several diagnostic scoring systems exist based on clinical, 
biochemical, immunologic and histologic characteristics of AIH. Additionally,
prognostic parameters can be identified. The purpose of this literature review is
to compare the clinical value, strengths and limitations of these diagnostic and 
prognostic scoring systems.
Methods: A literature search was performed in two databases and selected based on
diagnostic and prognostic criteria. Only studies concerning AIH in adults were
included.
Results: The backbone of scoring systems remains the revised AIH criteria
published in 1999 and the simplified from 2008. The revised system shows a higher
sensitivity, lower specificity and lower diagnostic accuracy compared to the
simplified. Limitations to these scoring systems include limited diagnostic
accuracy in acute or fulminant liver failure, insufficient inclusion of atypical 
auto-antibodies and lacking diagnostic power in presence of overlap syndromes.
Concerning these overlap syndromes, the Paris criteria show a higher diagnostic
accuracy compared to the scoring systems for AIH. Presently, no clinical
prognostic scoring systems are available. However, a first system based on
response to treatment accurately predicts long-term survival in AIH.
Conclusion: Diagnostic scoring systems are useful in diagnosing AIH and have
complementary value. However, they are no substitute for the gold standard of
appropriate clinical assessment and are mostly useful in defining cohorts for
research purposes. An evolution towards a more dynamic scoring system, using
prognostic parameters and the progression of typical features, seems more
valuable than the current diagnostic systems.

The large amount of biomedical data derived from wearable sensors, electronic
health records, and molecular profiling (e.g., genomics data) is rapidly
transforming our healthcare systems. The increasing scale and scope of biomedical
data not only is generating enormous opportunities for improving health outcomes 
but also raises new challenges ranging from data acquisition and storage to data 
analysis and utilization. To meet these challenges, we developed the Personal
Health Dashboard (PHD), which utilizes state-of-the-art security and scalability 
technologies to provide an end-to-end solution for big biomedical data analytics.
The PHD platform is an open-source software framework that can be easily
configured and deployed to any big data health project to store, organize, and
process complex biomedical data sets, support real-time data analysis at both the
individual level and the cohort level, and ensure participant privacy at every
step. In addition to presenting the system, we illustrate the use of the PHD
framework for large-scale applications in emerging multi-omics disease studies,
such as collecting and visualization of diverse data types (wearable, clinical,
omics) at a personal level, investigation of insulin resistance, and an
infrastructure for the detection of presymptomatic COVID-19.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of value-based payment models has led to
an increased use of the electronic health record to capture quality measures,
necessitating additional documentation requirements for providers.
METHODS: This case study uses text mining and natural language processing
techniques to identify the timely completion of diabetic eye exams (DEEs) from
26,203 unique clinician notes for reporting as an electronic clinical quality
measure (eCQM). Logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) using
unbalanced and balanced datasets, using the synthetic minority over-sampling
technique (SMOTE) algorithm, were evaluated on precision, recall, sensitivity,
and f1-score for classifying records positive for DEE. We then integrate a high
precision DEE model to evaluate free-text clinical narratives from our clinical
EHR system.
RESULTS: Logistic regression and SVM models had comparable f1-score and
specificity metrics with models trained and validated with no oversampling
favoring precision over recall. SVM with and without oversampling resulted in the
best precision, 0.96, and recall, 0.85, respectively. These two SVM models were
applied to the unannotated 31,585 text segments representing 24,823 unique
records and 13,714 unique patients. The number of records classified as positive 
for DEE using the SVM models ranged from 667 to 8,935 (2.7-36% out of 24,823,
respectively). Unique patients classified as positive for DEE ranged from 3.5 to 
41.8% highlighting the potential utility of these models.
DISCUSSION: We believe the impact of oversampling on SVM model performance to be 
caused by the potential of overfitting of the SVM SMOTE model on the synthesized 
data and the data synthesis process. However, the specificities of SVM with and
without SMOTE were comparable, suggesting both models were confident in their
negative predictions. By prioritizing to implement the SVM model with higher
precision over sensitivity or recall in the categorization of DEEs, we can
provide a highly reliable pool of results that can be documented through
automation, reducing the burden of secondary review. Although the focus of this
work was on completed DEEs, this method could be applied to completing other
necessary documentation by extracting information from natural language in
clinician notes.
CONCLUSION: By enabling the capture of data for eCQMs from documentation
generated by usual clinical practice, this work represents a case study in how
such techniques can be leveraged to drive quality without increasing clinician
work.

Testing machine learning techniques for general application by using protein
secondary structure prediction. A brief survey with studies of pitfalls and
benefits using a simple progressive learning approach.

Many researchers have recently used the prediction of protein secondary structure
(local conformational states of amino acid residues) to test advances in
predictive and machine learning technology such as Neural Net Deep Learning.
Protein secondary structure prediction continues to be a helpful tool in research
in biomedicine and the life sciences, but it is also extremely enticing for
testing predictive methods such as neural nets that are intended for different or
more general purposes. A complication is highlighted here for researchers testing
their methods for other applications. Modern protein databases inevitably contain
important clues to the answer, so-called "strong buried clues", though often
obscurely; they are hard to avoid. This is because most proteins or parts of
proteins in a modern protein data base are related to others by biological
evolution. For researchers developing machine learning and predictive methods,
this can overstate and so confuse understanding of the true quality of a
predictive method. However, for researchers using the algorithms as tools,
understanding strong buried clues is of great value, because they need to make
maximum use of all information available. A simple method related to the GOR
methods but with some features of neural nets in the sense of progressive
learning of large numbers of weights, is used to explore this. It can acquire
tens of millions and hence gigabytes of weights, but they are learned stably by
exhaustive sampling. The significance of the findings is discussed in the light
of promising recent results from AlphaFold using Google's DeepMind.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer represents
approximately 15-30% of all invasive breast cancers. Despite the recent advances 
in therapeutic practices of HER2 subtype, drug resistance and tumor recurrence
still have remained as major problems. Drug discovery is a long and difficult
process, so the aim of this study is to find potential new application for
existing therapeutic agents. Gene expression data for breast invasive carcinoma
were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The normal and tumor
samples were analyzed using Linear Models for Microarray Data (LIMMA) R package
in order to find the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). These genes were used
as entry for the library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) 
L1000CDS2 software and suggested 24 repurposed drugs. According to the obtained
results, some of these drugs including vorinostat, mocetinostat, alvocidib,
CGP-60474, BMS-387032, AT-7519, and curcumin have significant functional
similarity and structural correlation with FDA-approved breast cancer drugs.
Based on the drug-target network, which consisted of the repurposed drugs and
their target genes, the aforementioned drugs had the highest degrees. Moreover,
the experimental approach verified curcumin as an effective therapeutic agent for
HER2 positive breast cancer. Hence, our work suggested that some repurposed drugs
based on gene expression data can be noticed as potential drugs for the treatment
of HER2-positive breast cancer.

Liver cancer morbidity and mortality rates differ among ethnic groups. In the
United States, the burden of liver cancer in Asian Americans (AS) is higher
compared to Caucasian Americans (CA). Research on liver cancer health disparities
has mainly focused on environmental and socioeconomic factors yet has ignored the
genotypic differences among various racial/ethnic groups. This lack of molecular 
level understanding has hindered the development of personalized medical
approaches for liver cancer treatment. To understand the genetic heterogeneity of
liver cancer between AS and CA, we performed a systematic analysis of RNA-seq
data of AS and CA patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We used four
differential gene expression analysis packages; DESeq2, limma, edgeR, and
Superdelta2, to identify the differentially expressed genes. Our analysis
identified cytochrome P450-2D6 enzyme (CYP2D6) as the gene with the greatest
differential expression with higher levels in AS compared to CA. To scrutinize
the underlying mechanism of CYP2D6, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and
Cytoscape were conducted and found hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4A) and
interleukin-6 (IL6) in direct association with CYP2D6. IL6 is downregulated in AS
compared to CA, while HNF4A is not significantly different. Herein, we report
that CYP2D6 may serve as a putative biomarker in liver cancer health disparities.
Its negative association with IL6 proclaims an intricate relationship between
CYP2D6 and inflammation in the ethnic differences seen in AS and CA liver cancer 
patients. The goal of the present study was to understand how genetic factors may
contribute to the interethnic variability of liver cancer prevalence and outcomes
in AS and CA patients. Identifying ethnic-specific genes may help ameliorate
detection, diagnosis, surveillance, and treatments of liver cancer, as well as
reduce disease-related incidence and mortality rates in the vulnerable
population.

BACKGROUND: The first Covid-19 epidemic outbreak has enormously impacted the
delivery of clinical healthcare and hospital management practices in most of the 
hospitals around the world. In this context, it is important to assess whether
the clinical management of non-Covid patients has not been compromised. Among
non-Covid cases, patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and stroke need 
non-deferrable emergency care and are the natural candidates to be studied.
Preliminary evidence suggests that the time from onset of symptoms to emergency
department (ED) presentation has significantly increased in Covid-19 times as
well as the 30-day mortality and in-hospital mortality.
METHODS: We check, in a causal inference framework, the causal effect of the
hospital's stress generated by Covid-19 pandemic on in-hospital mortality rates
(primary end-point of the study) of AMI and stroke over several time-windows of
15-days around the implementation date of the State of Emergency restrictions for
COVID-19 (March, 9th 2020) using two quasi-experimental approaches,
regression-discontinuity design (RDD) and difference-in-regression-discontinuity 
(DRD) designs. Data are drawn from Spedali Civili of Brescia, one of the most hit
provinces in Italy by Covid-19 during March and May 2020.
FINDINGS: Despite the potential adverse effects on expected mortality due to a
longer time to hospitalization and staff extra-burden generated by the first wave
of Covid-19, the AMI and stroke mortality rates are overall not statistically
different during the first wave of Covid-19 than before the first peak. The
obtained results provided by RDD models are robust also when we account for
seasonality and unobserved factors with DRD models.
INTERPRETATION: The non-statistically significant impact on mortality rates for
AMI and stroke patients provides evidence of the hospital ability to manage -with
the implementation of a dual track organization- the simultaneous delivery of
high-quality cares to both Covid and non-Covid patients.
